         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </gap>he sermon whence the place was taken, as not S. <hi>S. Augustins, because,</hi> sayth he <hi>there were no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Peter,</hi> &amp; then addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thus: <hi>Praesertim cùm eumdem morbum in capite vestro notarint diu iam medico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum filij, etsi omnes non ego, id est, plus ego quàm omnes,</hi> that is to say, especially seeing that the Phisitians children haue now a long tyme noted the same disease in your head, althogh all not I that is to say, I more then all. Thus sayd my Lord, which seemed to me very mysticall, and so like a riddle, that I was fayne to ghesse at his meaning, and to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers constructions of it, touching aswell the Phisitians,
<pb n="LIIIj" facs="tcp:15521:33"/> as their children, and specially concerning the wordes <hi>etsi omnes non ego, id est, plus ego quàm omnes,</hi> of which I sayd thus in my <hi>Adioynder pag. 153. num. 33.</hi>

               <hi>24.</hi>
               <q>But although we may ghesse, who were the Physitians, and their children, yet it will not be so easy to coniecture what he meaneth by <hi>etsi omnes non ego, id est, plus ego quàm omnes,</hi> although all not I, that is to say, I more then all for truly I haue shewed it to diuers, and haue not found two that agree in the interpretation of it; but the most probable seemeth to be the one of two; one is, that he alludeth to the wordes of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> when he sayd, <hi>etsi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes scandalizati fuerint, sed non ego,</hi> althogh all shalbe scandalized, yet not I, who neuertheles was scandalized more then they all, because he alone deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maister; which sense hath great difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it neither hath connexion with that which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth immediatly before, nor is truely applyable to the Pope (of whome <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> seemeth there to treate) but is only contumelions to <hi>S. Peter</hi> (being a taunting kind of exprobation of his fall) and therefore me thinkes <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> should not admit it to be his meaning, as sauouring to much of impiety. The other sense is, that it should be referred to <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> himselfe, and that there is some little fault in the print, I meane in the points, though not in the words, which therefore should be pointed thus, <hi>etsi omnes, non ego?</hi> And if all, not I? that is to say,
<pb n="LV" facs="tcp:15521:33"/> of all haue noted this disease in your head, why should not I note it? Giuing to vnderstand, that he will not yeald to any of his brethren for zeale, and skill in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the faults of Popes, but rather <hi>plus ego quàm omnes,</hi> that is to say, therein will I go beyond them all; which sense hath at least some good coherence with the precedent clause, and well befitteth, <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> his zeale to the Ghospell, and hatred to the Pope, and so may passe for his meaning.</q>

So as if M. <hi>Collins</hi> will deny the power of the keyes to S. <hi>Peters</hi> own person, &amp; allow it only to the Church, because he represented the Church, the same must needes follow concerning the rest of the Apostles for the same reason.

What Catholike denieth, or doubteth, that for the loue of vnity, and the necessity therof in the church, our Sauiour did chuse one head of the Apostles, and of the whole church (and consequently to beare the person, and figure
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15521:60"/> of the church) not onely to shew the vnity therof, but also to cause, and to conserue vnity therin; as I haue proued in my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder out of <hi>S.

            <p n="18">18. But how doth this follow? Nay how euident is the contrary? to wit, that our Sauiour had so great respect, and loue to vnity, that for the conseruation therof in the church it seemed to his diuine wisedom most necessary to giue to one (<hi>viz.</hi> to S. <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors) most ample power, and authority to command, ordayne, &amp; punish, without the which neither schisms, nor he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resyes can either be preuented, or remedied, nor consequently vnity conserued; and this I say, is so euident, that my L. of <hi>VVinchester</hi> denyeth not <hi>Apol. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 219.

            <p n="19">19. In his fifth he sayth thus. Primatus, <hi>sayth he,</hi>
               <q>was not the Primacy of Magistracy, euen that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that he sayes the keyes were promised to him propter primatum. So that first the primacy, and then the keyes, and his primacy amongst the Apostles was a motiue cause to promise him the keyes in the name of the Church, whereas els <hi>Primatus,</hi> &amp; the keyes had gone togeather, and as soone <hi>Primatus,</hi> so soone the keyes; but now they are promised him for some speciallty in him, not for office then, as you would haue it.</q> Thus far <hi>M. Collins,</hi> who hauing gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as you haue heard before some kind of primacy in <hi>S. Peter,</hi> seeketh to exclude him heere from all primacy of gouernement, or magistracy (as he tearmeth it) and to that end he supposeth one thing, &amp; affirmeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, neither of them euer meant by <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</hi> He supposeth that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy before he represented the Church, &amp; affirmeth that the keyes were promised him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15521:61"/>
               <hi>propter Primatum,</hi> whereupon he argueth as you haue heard. But his supposition is flat against <hi>S. Augustines</hi> meaning in this place, who sayth, that <hi>gessit personam Ecclesiae propter Primatum: He bare the person of the Church for his Primacy</hi> (or in respect, or by reason of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,) wherof the naturall and cleare sense must needes be, that he represented the Church, because he was Primate, or chiefe of the Apostles; wherin the cause, and the effect are signifyed to concurre, as the King representeth the Commonwealth, because he is King or Head therof, and not because he being made King, is afterwards deputed to some such office of representation; but being King, he doth consequently, and by nature of his Regal office, and dignity beare the person of the Common wealth, that is to say, he doth conteine, &amp; cōprehend in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the whole authority, dignity, maiesty, &amp; power of the Commonwealth, which floweth from him, as from the head into al the members, &amp; parts of the political body.</p>
            <p n="20">20. This coniunction, &amp; concurrence of these two (although it is cleare inough in this place wherof we now treate) yet may be confirmed by another place alleadged by me before out of <hi>S. Augustine serm.</hi> 13. <hi>de verb. Dom.</hi> where he sayth, that <hi>Peter taking his name
<pb facs="tcp:15521:62"/> from a Rocke was happy, bearing the figure of the Church, hauing the principality of the Apostleship.</hi> Which manner of speach expresseth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of three thinges. The first, that he was made the foundation of the Church, which is signifyed by the change of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me taken frō a Rocke (alluding to the words and promise of our Sauiour <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou art Peter, &amp; vpon this Rocke will I build my Church</hi>) The second is that he represēted the church. The third, that he had the principality of the Apostleship. And of those three thinges, the two later are necessary consequent of the first; for being the foundation of the Church he was consequently the head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and being head of the Church, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented the whole body thereof, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently was Prince, and chiefe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: so as all those do so necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude one another, that they cannot be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="21">21. And that <hi>S Augustine</hi> his meaning was that <hi>S.

               <q>the Primacy was the motiue cause why the keyes were promised him.

Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> before alleadged. But I would gladly know of him, where he findeth in those words, &amp; in that place, that the keyes were promised to <hi>S. Peter, for his primacy.</hi> That which I find there, and al that can be found is, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> represented the Church, or bare the person of it for his primacy, which signifyeth plainely, as I haue shewed alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the concurrence of S. <hi>Peters</hi> bearing the person of the Church with his primacy (as of a necessary effect with the cause) but of promising the keyes, &amp; much lesse of giuing them before, or after his Primacy, sooner, or later, there is not so much as one word in that place of S. <hi>Augustine;</hi> and therfore he may be ashamed to say, as he doth, to wit, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth: <hi>The keyes were promised
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15521:63"/> him, propter Primatum,</hi> seeing that he neither sayth, nor meaneth it. And his conclusion is not only as false, as his premisses, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ridiculous. For he sayth: <hi>But now</hi> (the keyes) <hi>are promised him for some speciallty in him, and not for office then, as you would haue it.</hi> So he, distinguishing, as you see, betwixt some <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality</hi> in <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and his Office, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that the keyes were promised him for the one, and not for the other.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But good <hi>M. Collins,</hi> resolue vs heer what difference you make betwixt that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality in <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and his office, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your premisses must needes be all one; for you sayd before, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayes, <hi>The keyes were promised to him, propter Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum, for his primacy;</hi> and now you conclude that the keyes were promised him for some <hi>speciality</hi> in him; and therefore that <hi>speciallty</hi> must needes be his Primacy, if you will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with <hi>S.

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:15521:64"/> for his office, that is to say, for his <hi>Primacy</hi> (supposing as you do, that he had his office before the promise of the keyes,) for in my poore vnderstanding he was no officer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the keyes were both promised, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him; so as you haue, I will not say belyed both S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and me, but truly you haue mistaken vs both very much.

            </p>
            <p n="27">27. To declare therfore in what this similitude, and comparison betwixt <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> holdeth; it is to be vnderstood that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> compareth them onely in two things: the one in that, as <hi>Peter</hi> bare the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Church, in a figure <hi>propter primatum,</hi> for his primacy amongst the Apostles, so did <hi>Iudas</hi> beare the person of the wicked Iewes <hi>quodam modo</hi> (sayth <hi>S. Augustine) after a certayne manner;</hi> giuing to vnderstand therby, that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not so properly figure, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the wicked Iewes as <hi>S. Peter</hi> figured and represented the Church, but onely <hi>quodam modo, in a certaine manner:</hi> as who would say that <hi>Iudas</hi> being, as it were, the Captayne and ringleader of Christes enemies (in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his exorbitant, and excessiue malice, wherin he surmounted thē all) might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be said to haue a kynde of primacy or superiority amongst them, and so to beare their person, or to represent them, as <hi>S. Peter</hi> did truly beare the person of the Church, in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:15521:66"/> respect of the true, and reall primacy which he had amongst the disciples of Christ.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The other thing, wherin they are compared is, that as certaine things which were spoken to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and did properly belong to him, can haue no cleere sense, but when they are referred to the church, so in like manner some things which we read in the 108. psalme concerning <hi>Iudas,</hi> and are properly spoken of him, may be conuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly vnderstood also of the wicked Iewes, as hauing relation to thē; &amp; in this later point consisteth the chief force of <hi>S.

Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iudas;</hi> and therfore, it were most absurd to inferre a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rity betwixt them in other things, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended either at all, or not so principally by <hi>S. Augustine;</hi> as namely betwixt <hi>S. Peters</hi> reall, and true Primacy (which <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him to haue had amongst the Apostles) and that kind of Captaynship (as I may tearme it) which may be imagined in <hi>Iudas</hi> (for really he had none) amongst the wicked Iewes; so as, albeyt there may be some comparison in respect of the Analogy, or proportion, which we may conceiue betwixt them; yet a reall, proper, and true parity, or equality there can not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then in imagination.</p>
            <p n="29">
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:15521:66"/>29. Furthermore if <hi>M.

Peter</hi> by their concession was to haue in Synodes, or Councels of the Apostles: for this must needes follow if their argument be good against vs; seeing that this comparison, maketh as much against <hi>S. Peters</hi> primacy of place, &amp; order (which <hi>M. Collins</hi> graunteth) as against the primacy of power which wee acknowledge in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; he denieth.

But for the more full and cleere cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of this Cauill of his (albeyt this which I haue already sayd might suffice) I will lay down another obiection, &amp; argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, of the same nature, which he vrgeth mightily afterwards, spending ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 4. or 5. whole pages; the answere wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

            <p n="7">7. In the meane tyme we see accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>S. Augustine</hi> that not only S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but also our Sauiour himselfe represented and signifyed the whole Church, whereof he was head, as also the diuers members, and partes thereof, to wit the weake, and the strong. Will then <hi>M. Collins</hi> aske vs now of our Sauiour, as he doth of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> whether he could signify the Church, which he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned? And whether he was at one tyme Gouernour of the strong, and another tyme of the weake? and lastly then how he could be an Vniuersall gouernour of his Church? I hope he wilbe better aduised, &amp; learne by this, that as our Sauior Christ was &amp; is the Vniuersall Gouernor of his Church, though he represented the same, and signified also
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15521:74"/> the weake, and strong therin: so also <hi>S. Peter</hi> might be Vniuersal gouernor of the Church vnder Christ, &amp; beare the person, or figure therof <hi>propter primatum</hi> (as S. <hi>Aug.</hi> saith) albeyt he figured sometims the weake &amp; sometims the strong. Therfore I may well say to <hi>M. Collins</hi> of our Sauiour, as he sayd to me of S. <hi>Peter pag</hi> 16. I thinke you see cause to repent your construction, or argument, except you be weary of Christs vniuersall dominion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But now let vs see him shoot his third bolt taken also out of <hi>S.

            <p n="9">9. By the occasion of this I haue sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. that S. <hi>Peter</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, and figure the Church in a very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner, not common to euery Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, but as the first Gouernour therof, in whose person the Ecclesiasticall Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy (which was to ēdure to the worlds end) was erected, and instituted; in which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect those things which were sayd to him, expressing the power and authority giuen him (as <hi>Tibi dabo claues, Pasce oues meas,</hi> and the like) were spoken in regard aswel of the Church for euer, as of his owne person; for otherwise the sayd authority had dyed, &amp; ended in him, and with him, &amp; had not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:15521:82"/> descended to his successors, &amp; to the whole Church for euer, as it did; and therefore <hi>S.

            <p n="10">10.

The 3. fault of <hi>S.

            <p n="5">5. Heere you see he alleadgeth two reasons, why I omitted this fault of <hi>S.

Peter</hi> (whome we hold for the Monarch of the world) to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> a latter Apostle. As for the former he may be ashamed truly to draw it neere to an errour in fayth, which some of the Fathers do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse from al errour, holding that this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of <hi>S. Peter</hi> by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> touching his dissimulation with the Iewes in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their Ceremoniall law, grew vpō an agreement betwixt them two; to the end that the Iewes seeing <hi>S. Peter</hi> receiue with patience a rebuke at <hi>S.

Peter</hi> condescended more then he should haue done to the infirmity of the Iewes, and that therfore he was reprehensible, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayd of him <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. yet neyther he, nor any other Father thought, that eyther it was an errour in fayth, or yet that it drew neere vnto it, as M. <hi>Collins</hi> saith it did, against all reason, seeing it consisted only in his cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation with the Iewes, which was no matter of fayth, but an act lawfull in it self, though reprehensible in respect of some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, to wit for the scandall that the Gentills might take thereby; so that the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was not in fayth, but in prudence, (yea a materiall, and no formall errour, as the Schoolmen speake, &amp; cōsequently voide of sinne) and yet, as I haue sayd, blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15521:93"/> in respect of the inconuenience which might haue grown of it, if it had passed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controled.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But I would gladly know heere of M. <hi>Collins,</hi> what he should gayne by it, or we loose more then he, if he could proue it to be an error in fayth; for this being only a priuate error of S. <hi>Peters</hi> person, it could not preiudice the authority of our Popes publik decrees (which is the marke that M. <hi>Collins</hi> aymes at) for we hold not, that the Pope cā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in his priuate actions, &amp; opinions as a priuate person, but that he cānot erre in the publike decrees, which he maketh, and proposeth to the whole Church.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15521:93"/> but in fact only, &amp; so proue nothing against our Popes; or if he say heerred, or could erre in faith, he shaketh the authority of all the new testament, no lesse then the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all the Popes decrees: so as you see how impertinently he bableth to proue some fraud in me, for the omission of this errour in S. <hi>Peter.</hi> And thus much to his first reason why I omitted it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. His second is, that I thought good to leaue it out, least I might therby subiect the Monarch of the world to the open resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and reprehension of <hi>an abortiue,</hi> that it to say, least I might subiect S. <hi>Peter</hi> to S. <hi>Paul</hi> who was a later Apostle, and according to our doctrine inferiour and subiect to S. <hi>Peter:</hi> but in this M. <hi>Collins</hi> must needs speak agaynst his owne knowledge, and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, see ng that he saw afterwards in my Adioynder, that I was so farre from fearing any preiudice to S. <hi>Peters</hi> primacy by this his error, and by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> reprehension ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that I held, and proued it to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and fortifyed therby, according to the collection and inference that the auncient Fathers made therof, namely S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>S.

And therfore I say, that if S.</hi> Peter <hi>should haue stood vpon his primacy in defense of his erroneous act, and sayd that</hi> Paul <hi>ought to obey him therin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was the primate, and head of the Apostles, he had both sayd and done insolently, which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse in the defense of a truth, or vpon some other iust occasion he might both say and do without al note of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency, yea iustly, and necessarily, because he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the primacy, and therefore was to be obeyed, and followed in all good, and iust actions.</hi> Thus sayd I in my Adioynder.</p>

The other fraud is a flat corruption, and falsification of my text, which he layeth downe in a different letter thus: <hi>If S. Peter should haue refused to follow, and to obey</hi> S.

            <p n="19">19.

To which wise question, grounded vpon his owne corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my text, I shall need to say no more, hauing discouered the weaknes, and falsity of his ground; only I will add, that no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy can exempt any man from the frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall correction, and admonition of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, when the same is giuen necessarily,

            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus farre I alleadged S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in my Adioynder, to explicate, and answere the place alleadged my L. of <hi>VVinchester</hi> out of him, &amp; I doubt not but it is euident by <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his owne exposition of the words <hi>pasce oues meas,</hi> that when he sayd that all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours receyued Christs sheepe togeather with S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he had no meaning to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne, or deny therby S. <hi>Peters</hi> primacy (which you see he expresly affirmeth, and teacheth heer) but rather to confirme it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>S. Augustines</hi> doctrine, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; who vsing the same manner of speach that Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth, as you haue heard, doth also yield the reason thereof, to wit, that for as much as <hi>S. Peter</hi> represēted the Church <hi>propter primatum quem in discipulis habuit, for the primacy which he had amongst the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> therfore the Apostles, and all other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:15521:107"/> receiued their pastorall authority in him, and with him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But now M. <hi>Collins</hi> taketh hold of my owne words, and vrgeth them against me, because I said <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 7. that the words of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> to wit, <hi>nobiscum eas sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit</hi> (which I haue charged my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> to haue added to the text) do inforce a greater equality betwixt <hi>S.

Ambrose</hi> did imagine; but my meaning was, that to the ignorant reader it would seeme so, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I said afterwards <hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>lin.</hi> 13. that these words make a greater shew of parity, or equality. But if they be well considered, the sense is all one, be the words either as he, or I alleadged them; for as I had them, they signify, that we receaued the sheepe with <hi>Peter;</hi> and as his LP. alleadged them, they signify that <hi>S. Peter</hi> receiued thē with vs, and wee with him, which is in effect all one; for if we receiued them with him, then he receiued them with vs; and if he with vs, then wee with him: and this, as I haue said, is true in respect of his primacy, wherby he represented al the pastors of the church to the worlds end, as I haue signified amply before <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 7. by the similitud of a first Monarch, or king, of whom it may

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Let vs now see what M. <hi>Collins</hi> sayth to the place of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> which I produced to interprete the other, in which place <hi>S.

The place is laid downe by me a litle before as I alleadged it in my Adioynder <hi>pag.</hi> 7. <hi>num.</hi> 8. where I also added <hi>num.</hi> 9. three thinges to be noted therein.

First he layeth hold vpon the words, <hi>Quia s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Ambrose</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged any authority in <hi>S. Peter</hi> more then in others by the word <hi>anteferri,</hi> but only a kind of excellency, which he sayth a few lines before <hi>pag</hi> 47. <hi>lin. antepenult.</hi> is that <hi>primatus praestantiae,</hi> by the which my L. of <hi>VVinchester foyled my friuolous obiection euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was batched.</hi> And he asketh me by the way, whether he doth not seeme to me too grammaticall? Wherto I answere that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:15521:109"/> I thinke he hath more Grammer, then wit to vse it well, and yet no more gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer neither, then he hath need of, as may appeare by his correction of my translatiō of <hi>obstrepere,</hi> and <hi>repraesentare</hi> in his preface; &amp; what good vse he maketh of his skill in grammer, yea and of this difference which he maketh heere betwixt <hi>anteferri,</hi> and <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni</hi> thou shalt see, good reader, heerafter in his answere to a like place of <hi>S. Leo,</hi> wherin <hi>praeponi</hi> is vsed in the very same sense, which heere he signifieth, and yet it will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to perswade him, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had any authority ouer the rest of the Apostles; as shall appeare after in this chapter <hi>num.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But to proceed, he telleth me, that <hi>anteferri</hi> is to be esteemed, or graced before another; and to shew his copie and plenty of Latin, he sayeth it is like <hi>anteire, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellere;</hi> and afterwards giueth 3. instances of <hi>S. Peter</hi> excellencies. The first, that he was bid to feede, <hi>as one, in whose person others were exhorted: &amp; the Church represented</hi> The second, that he was promised martyrdome in these words, <hi>cùm senueris.</hi> And the third, that he had a priority like <hi>charity amōgst other vertues, which is,</hi> sayth he, <hi>to be principall indeed, but not to rule;</hi> and addeth for the proofe therof, that the <hi>Vertues of the prosequutiue part, rule not the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:15521:109"/> intellectuall, but are ruled rather.</hi> So he: and now do you not se how this pedant, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>S. Peter</hi> from all authority, and rule, doth out of his Grammer rules labour to ouerrule, and controlle <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting flatly his exposition of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours words? which, as you haue heard, he vnderstandeth clearly of rule, &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, saying: <hi>oues pascere iubetur, perfectiores vt perfectior gubernaret:</hi> that is to say, <hi>S. Peter is commaunded to feed the shepe, to the end that he being more perfect, might rule, or gouerne the more perfect.</hi> Wherby he signifieth plainly what he meaneth by <hi>anteferri,</hi> to wit, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was preferred before the rest in authority, rule, and gouernment: had not this fellow reason, thinke you, to nippe off, or at least to dissemble those words of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> to make good his Grammaticall conceit?</p>
            <p n="10">10. The like may also be said of his discourse, which followeth <hi>num.</hi> 33. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Vicarium amoris,</hi> in <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he maketh an ample comment, ouer long, and idle to be set downe heere, but the summe, and scope of all is, to proue by diuers examples, that the title of <hi>Vicari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="11">11. But now M. <hi>Collins</hi> goeth on with his extrauagant discourse to impugne an obseruation which I make out of <hi>S.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:15521:110"/> they signify clearly, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>māded to feede the sheep (that is to say the more perfect) that he might gouerne them, which he in his glosse vpon <hi>anteferri</hi> deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be meant by S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> as you haue heard, acknowledging onely a certaine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority to be allowed by S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> such a one as <hi>Charity</hi> hath amongst the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that is to say to be principall, but not to <hi>rule;</hi> which word <hi>rule,</hi> he also putteth in a different letter, to be the better noted, as no way intended by <hi>S.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15521:115"/> him before <hi>S.

            <p n="21">21.

            </p>
            <p n="22">22. But now, to returne for a while to <hi>M.

Collins</hi> who hath deifyed him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him <hi>the diuine man,</hi> might rather haue noddified him, and himself for company, when he meant to noddify me. But he that will see what a diuine man <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> is, let him read <hi>F.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15521:116"/> most glorieth, and this euidently appeareth as well by the obseruation of his errours made by <hi>F.

            <p n="23">23. And allthough it may perhapps seem a needles labour to enlarge my self in this place further vpon <hi>M. Caesaubon,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I fynd (euen in that chapter of his Exercitations, whereto <hi>M.

Collins</hi> in the present Controuersy betwixt him and me. Therfore it is to be vnderstood that wheras
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:15521:116"/> the Cardinall in his 4. booke <hi>de Rom Pont. cap.</hi> 16. sayth, that when our Sauiour said to <hi>S. Peter, Pasce oues meas,</hi> he vsed <hi>vocabulo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> a Kingly word; and in his recognition of all his Workes speaking of that place, sayth, that it may be gathered by the words of our Sauiour, that he gaue to S. <hi>Peter</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to gouerne <hi>regio more,</hi> after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a king, remitting his Reader for the further explication therof to his first booke <hi>de Rom.

(where he bringeth diuers places of the holy Scriptures, and some out of profane authors to proue that <hi>pasce,</hi> is oftymes vsed for <hi>regere,</hi> to gouerne, as well in the Greeke, as in the Latin;) <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> willfully, &amp; maliciously miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strueth the Cardinals meaning, vrging and exaggerating his words further, then euer he meant to extend them.</p>
            <p n="24">24. For his intention was no other, but onely to signify that the gouernement of the Church is by the institution of our Sauiour truly Monarchicall, that is to say a lawfull, iust, and moderate Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnder one head, such as is the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement of a iust, and good King, who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (according to <hi>Aristotle</hi>) the good of his subiects, and not his owne, may truely be called, <hi>Paeter patriae</hi> the Father of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:15521:117"/> the refuge of the poore, the defence of the innocent, and the comfort of all his distressed subiects, such as <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; <hi>Moyses</hi> are described to be in the holy Scriptures; yea such as the very Paynim Philosophers (who treat of the office, &amp; duety of a good king) require him to be; that is to say, not onely to be the minister of Almighty God, to administer iustice, but also to be most like him in innocency, liberality, longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, patience, mercy, and in all vertue, and goodnes, as <hi>Plutarch,</hi> following <hi>Plato,</hi> teacheth notably in his treatise <hi>de doctrina Principum,</hi> and in the life of <hi>Aristides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="25">25. This then being so, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals meaning no other (when he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a kingly gouernmēt in the church) what reason, or honest meaning hath <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> to stretch the Cardinals words, &amp; intention to a tyrannicall gouernment, &amp; to inueigh against him for the same, as he doth? to which purpose it is also to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that whereas the Cardinall produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth diuers places of Holy Scripture, and prophane Authours (as I haue signified before) to proue that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in greeke, and <hi>pascere</hi> in Latine, are many tymes vsed for, <hi>regere,</hi> to gouerne; <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> himself expoundeth these places to signify
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:15521:117"/> only, that the office of a King is to gouerne his people with such tendernes, sweetnes, and louing affection, as sheepheards are wont to gouerne their flockes, which was also the Cardinalls meaning, who in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a Kingly manner of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement in the Church, and producing those places for the proofe thereof, had no other intention, then to denote the most iust, sweet, moderate, and pastorall gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement that may be. But seeing that M. <hi>Casaubon</hi> is scandalized with the wordes <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium,</hi> and <hi>impera,</hi> I meruaile how he doth brooke and digest the vse therof in the holy Scripture, as 1. <hi>Petr.</hi> 2. where our priesthood is called <hi>Regale sacerdotium,</hi> a kingly Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15521:118"/> that it signifyeth a most iust, milde, and moderate gouernement, that is to say, the gouernement of a iust, and good King; in which sense the <hi>Cardinall</hi> taketh it, as I haue declared before.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Neuertheles I must aduertise <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> by the way, that although the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church ought to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall, that is to say most moderate, and sweet; yet not so moderate, gentle, and sweet, but that the pastor may, when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion requireth, vse his pastorall staffe to correct a straying sheep, and beate him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fould; &amp; if there should be a scabbed sheep in the flock, though perhaps he were as good a Grammarian as <hi>M. Casaubon,</hi> or as great a Doctour as <hi>M. Collins,</hi> yet the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard might with his sheep-hooke draw him by the legg out of the fould, yea and if he were incurable he might giue him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the butchers handes, least otherwise he might infect the whole flocke. And this I thinke could not seeme to any reasonable man, either tyrannicall, or vnfit for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a good Pastour described (as <hi>M. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon</hi> sayth) by <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen orat.</hi> 1. saving: <hi>Pastor non vtitur multùm pedo, fistula ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò plurimùm: the Sheepheard doth not much vse his staffe, or sheep-hooke, but his whistle very much,</hi> that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15521:118"/> is to say, he vseth more lenity, then seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, oftener preaching and exhorting, then punishing, yet punishing sometymes euen with seuerity, when there is iust occasion for a publike good.</p>
            <p n="27">27. For what more seuere punishmēt can there be, then <hi>S. Peter</hi> vsed to chastice <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> whome he stroke with suddain death <hi>Act.</hi> 5? Or then <hi>S. Paul</hi> vsed in the punishment of the incestuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> deliuering him to Satan 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. punishing him thereby as well in body, as in soule? And this <hi>M. Casaubon</hi> himselfe seemeth not to deny, when he sayth in the end after his long inuectiue against the Cardinall: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que hoc dicimus,</hi> sayth he, <hi>quod putemus &amp;c. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I say this, because I thinke that the spirituall pastor doth lacke spirituall power to punish his rebels after a spiritual manner &amp;c.</hi> meaning, no doubt that he may punish by way of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and censures; which albeit, they do principally concerne the soule, yet do consequently induce many tymes bodily or temporall punishment; but whether they do, or no, the only spirituall is more seuere, and terrible, then any bodily, or temporall punishment in the world; and therefore no man that hath such esteeme of spirituall punishments (especially of excō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:15521:119"/> and Ecclesiasticall censures) as a good Christian ought to haue, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that the spiritual pastor may vse ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and seuerity, when occasion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
            <p n="28">28.

Casaubon</hi> hath so hemd him in, as I may say with the authority of <hi>Theophilact,</hi> that he cannot start out: for <hi>Theophilact</hi> declareth plainely euen in the same place, which <hi>M.

            <p n="31">31. Therefore I leaue it now, good Reader, to thee to iudge who is the <hi>Noddy,</hi> I, whome <hi>M Collins</hi> calleth so, and sendeth to schoole to <hi>M.

For whereas he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to answere my former obiection out of <hi>S.

               </q> So he, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling altogeather the mention of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and reducing all by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to a bare feeding, as that <hi>S.

            <p n="32">
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:15521:121"/>32. But this deep deuise of his is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly dashed with those few wordes of <hi>S.

            <p n="33">33. And now to those I will yet add one other testimony out of S. <hi>Leo,</hi> which I obiected in my Adioynder <hi>pag.</hi> 24. <hi>nu.</hi> 22. and <hi>M.

               <q>Peter was chosen out of the whole world to haue
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:15521:121"/> the chiefe charge of the vocation of the Gentills, and of all the Apostles, &amp; of all the Fathers of the Church, to the end, that albeit there be many Priests amongst the people of God, and many Pastours; <hi>omnes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men propriè regat Petrus,</hi> yet Peter may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly gouerne them all, whome Christ doth also prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally gouerne.</q> Thus sayth <hi>S. Leo,</hi> teaching expresly that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had the gouernment, as well of the Apostles themselues, as of all other Pastors of the Church vnder Christ, who is the principall gouernour of them all.</p>
            <p n="34">34. And what sayth <hi>M. Collins</hi> to this trow you? Marry forsooth he layth downe part of the place, thus: <q>
                  <hi>Peter was chosen out of the whole world to haue the chiefe charge of the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gentills, and of all the Apostles, and of all the Fathers of the Church.</hi>
               </q> Thus much he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth, and then sayth, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heere for my turne, saue that <hi>Peter</hi> was chosen to <hi>haue the charge of the Apostles,</hi> &amp; therfore in answere therof sayth a little after. <q>Neither doe we deny, that <hi>Peter</hi> might haue the charge of the Apostles, yet no commaunding charge but either as <hi>ferrum acuit ferrum,</hi> one yron whets, and sharpens another (so the face of one brother to quicken another by his encouragements, <hi>confirma fratres</hi>) or <hi>bono vnitatis,</hi> preferred for his maturity to preuent schisme, and disorder, as
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:15521:122"/> hath beene tould you; though the name (Apostles) is common to some without the company of the twelue, and the Scripture vseth it so Philip. <hi>2.25.</hi> whome Peter might be charged with, and with the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the church (as <hi>Leo</hi> calls heere the Bishops of their making) without derogating from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them properly so called.</q> So he, granting three thinges, with certaine limitations, whereby he would seeme fully to haue answered me for this place; the first is, that <hi>Peter</hi> might haue the charge of the Apostls, but no commanding charge. The second that he was preferred before the rest, only, for the good of vnity, and in respect of his maturity (for the which he remitteth me to what he hath told me before.) The third is, that he might haue the charge of such, as were tearmed Apostles, and were none of the twelue.</p>
            <p n="35">35. But if <hi>M. Collins</hi> had beene as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest a man, as a Doctor of Diuinity should be, I meane, if he had alleadged the whole place of <hi>S. Leo,</hi> as he found it in my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder (&amp; cannot be denyed to be the true words of the Authour) I thinke he could not for shame haue sayd any of these three things; for you may see in the place before alleadged, that after the wordes of S. <hi>Leo,</hi> layd downe by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> there followeth
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:15521:122"/> immediatly this: <q>
                  <hi>Vt quamuis in populo Dei multi sunt sacerdotes &amp;c. that albeyt there be many Priests among the people of God, and many pastors; yet that</hi> Peter <hi>may properly gouerne them all, whome Christ doth also principally gouerne.</hi>
               </q> Thus sayth <hi>S. Leo,</hi> which quite ouerthroweth <hi>M. Collins</hi> his glosse, who acknowledgeth that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had the charge of the Apostles, but <hi>no commāding charge;</hi> wheras <hi>S. Leo</hi> speaketh expresly of a charge of gouernement, that is to say, a commaunding charge. Againe, <hi>M. Collins</hi> graunteth that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was preferred before the rest in respect of his maturity, and for the good of vnity; and <hi>S. Leo</hi> telleth vs, what S. <hi>Peters</hi> preferment was, <hi>viz.</hi> that he did <hi>properly gouerne all the Pastours of the Church, whome Christ doth principally gouerne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="36">36. But heere I cannot forget, good Reader, to put thee in mind by the way of what hath passed before in this very Chap. <hi>num.</hi> 8. in his answere to the place of Saint <hi>Ambrose pag.</hi> 48. where he obserued (out of the depth of his Grammaticall science) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great difference betwixt <hi>anteferri,</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni.</hi> Anteferri (sayth he) <hi>is one thing, and</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni <hi>is another; the later may be of authority, the first of any excellency.</hi> So as if S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>praeponi,</hi> as he did <hi>anteferri,</hi> Maister <hi>Collins</hi> would haue graunted, as it seemeth, that he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:15521:123"/> had acknowledged in S. <hi>Peter</hi> a preferment of authority, and gouernement; which therefore I must desire him to graunt me now in this place of <hi>Saint Leo,</hi> who for the wordes, which I translate, <hi>to haue the chiefe charge of the Apostles,</hi> hath in Latin <hi>praeponatur omnibus Apostolis,</hi> which no doubt M. <hi>Collins</hi> saw in the Latin (for I make no doubt but he would examine the place in S. <hi>Leo</hi>) and yet you see he will not graunt to <hi>S. Peter</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authority more then to the rest of the Apostles, so as <hi>praeponi</hi> hath now no more force with him, then <hi>anteferri;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leaue it to thy iudgment, good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what credit his Grammaticall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations deserue to haue with others, seeing he maketh so little account of them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p n="37">37. But now to proceed with his 3. note vpon the words of <hi>S. Leo,</hi> wheras he hopeth to finde a starting hole by the name (Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles) because it is sometymes applyed to those, which were none of the 12. or of the colledge of the Apostles, <hi>S.

Collins</hi> fraudulently concealed (as he did before, that other of S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>) doth vtterly marre his market: for if the 12. Apostles were to be comprehended (as no doubt they were) amongst those Priestes, and pastors <hi>whome Christ doth principally gouerne,</hi> he must needs graunt, that according to <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p n="38">38. Behold then what an absurd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere he hath shaped vs heere, besides the notable fraude that he hath vsed therin; so as I may well say, that if he answere ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes no better in the publick actes, &amp; commēcementes at <hi>Cambrige,</hi> he will shame the Vniuersity, and deserue to be hyssed out of the Schooles.

            <p n="39">39. But now to returne to the place of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> from the which I haue a little digressed, and to come to the conclusion

            <p n="42">42. But then, I would know whether
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:15521:126"/> a Wether be a sheep, by <hi>M. Collins</hi> his gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and if he be, why a Ramme may not be a sheep also; &amp; againe whether because <hi>Agnus</hi> is of the masculine gender, there be any she lambes, and consequently whether they were vnder <hi>Peters</hi> iurisdiction, when our Sauiour sayd vnto him <hi>pasce agnos meos,</hi> and if they were, why then the male sheep, that is to say the Rammes, and Wethers could not be included in <hi>pasce oues meas,</hi> and in the number of those sheep, of whom the Royall Prophet sayth: <hi>oues &amp; boues, &amp; pecora campi &amp;c. psal.</hi> 8. and of those of whome he sayd also 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 24. <hi>Isti qui oues sunt, quid fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt: these which were sheep what haue they done?</hi> And finally when our Sauiour shall place the sheep vpon his right hand, &amp; the goats vpon his left, if the Rammes be not sheep, where shall they stand? Do I seeme to you <hi>M. Collins</hi> too grāmatical, as you sayd to me whyle ere? But truly if you were not more seely then a sheep, you would neuer haue denyed Rammes to be sheep, as you do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding them from the distinction of sheep and lambes.</p>
            <p n="43">43. But now to come to the third foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery (which truly I know not whether it be more foolish or fraudulēt:) <q>
                  <hi>Arietes,</hi> sayth he, are (by the opinion of two Iesuits <hi>Turri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:15521:126"/> and Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi>) to be vnderstood to be the Apostles, or Bishops their succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, and Kings, who therfore being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sheep, nor lambes, are excluded from the dominion of <hi>Peter:</hi> and so (as he sayth) I haue spunne a faire threed to shut them out whome by that very tricke (he meaneth the distinction of sheepe and lambes) I would haue shut in.</q> How faire the threed is, that I haue spunne, I leaue it to the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of others; but sure I am, that of my faire threed (if it be a faire one) he hath wouen a very foule, false, and weake web, arguing as simply, and ignorantly, as you haue heard him before <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>num.</hi> 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. out of a similitude, or comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> applying it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose then it serueth for, wherein he is so much the more inexcusable heer, for that he hath taken this out of <hi>Tolet</hi> vpon the 15 chap. of <hi>S. Iohn annotat.</hi> 3. who trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the false application of similitudes, and of the weaknes of arguments grounded theron, bringeth this example, that Christ is compared in the Scripture to a lambe, and Kings to Rammes: <q>Neuerthelesse sayth he, it doth not follow theron, that Kinges are greater then Christ, because ramms are greater then lambes, <hi>Id enim tantùm ex para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bola
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:15521:127"/> petendum est, ad quod significandum est proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> for that only is to be drawne, or taken from a parable, or similitude, for the which it is proposed.</q> Thus sayth <hi>Tolet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="44">44. Now then M. <hi>Collins</hi> taketh out of <hi>

Peter,</hi> no more then with relation to Christ; and therefore, as the argument was not good, and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproued by <hi>Tolet,</hi> which referred them to Christ, no more could any argument be good, that should any way referre them to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> because as I haue sayd, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of rammes with Kings was not made, nor is vsed in the Scripture to any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch purpose; but if such an argument coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be good, <hi>M. Collins</hi> would be vtterly spoyled with his comparison; for seeing that the Rams (albeit they are leaders of the whole flocke, yet) are no lesse subiect to the sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, then the meanest sheep in the fold; it would follow directly, that Kinges are no lesse subiect to <hi>S. Peter</hi> (to whom Christ
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15521:127"/> gaue commission to feed his sheep) then the poorest Christian in their kingdomes.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Thus thou seest, good Reader, what a faire threed M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath spunne in shutting in both Apostles, and Kinges within the iurisdiction and gouernement of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> by the very same tricke, wherby he thought to shut them out, and so remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth foyled euery way, euen by his owne argument, besides his notable abuse of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>S.

               </gap>th you heard him charge me once, and call me <hi>wretch,</hi> when neuertheles not I, but he himself was taken tardy with it, in the same place, as you may see before <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>num.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. If therefore he had found me halting in this manner, how would he haue triumphed, and treated me thinke you? What names, and titles would he haue bestowed vpon me, as he doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes without any cause calling me, <hi>VVretch, Noddy, Hobbyhorse, Mastiff Dogge, Curre false Theef, a souterly fellow,</hi> &amp; what not? But for my part I will say no more of him, but that he is a great Grammarian, and a deep
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:15521:128"/> Doctor of Diuinity, and that if he may stil be imployed for a writer, the Vniuersity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> will haue much honour by him, Kings College a notable Ornament, and the Clergy of England a great light, the Ghospell great increase, my Lord of <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> a doughty, and worthy Champion, all his friends a singular comfort, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I, poore wretch, and the Catholikes are like to haue a terrible, and a potent aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, God help vs; for, <hi>Si Deus nobiscum, quis contra nos?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">46. But now to conclude this matter, and Chapter, you haue heard what he hath thought good to say to my answere to the first exception that my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> makes against our argument drawne from <hi>pasce oues meas,</hi> consisting in the authority of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and I doubt not but you haue clearely seene three thinges. First that the charge of a lame, and fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent quotation of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> which I layd vpon my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> remayneth good, for ought that <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath beene able to say to the contrary, seeing I haue shewed clearely that the wordes, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the place alleadged by my Lord (to proue that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had no more authority by <hi>pasce oues meas,</hi> then the rest of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:15521:128"/> the Apostles) did proue the contrary; sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying expresly that those wordes were sayd to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> as he bare the person of the Church, which he did (according to <hi>S. Augustins</hi> expresse doctrine) <hi>propter prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> in respect of his primacy; &amp; that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayd, that which my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> obiecteth out of him, to wit, <hi>Cum Petro dicitur, ad omnes dicitur, pasce oues me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> when it was sayd to <hi>Peter,</hi> it was sayd to all, feed my sheep; because he being primate, and chiefe pastor of the Church, receaued that commission for himselfe, and for the whole Church; so as my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> obiecting the wordes of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> contrary to his meaning, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the reason thereof (which was expressed sufficiently in the same place) was worthily charged by me with a lame, and fraudulent quotation, wherof you see M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath no way discharged him.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Secondly whereas M. <hi>Collins</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing my Lord of <hi>VVincester</hi> hath expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the primacy, which <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to be <hi>a primacy of place, or excellency,</hi> and not of authority, or gouernement; you see I haue proued the contrary, as well out of S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers in the precedent Chapters, as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:15521:129"/> now in this out of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> and S. <hi>Leo,</hi> who teach <hi>S. Peters</hi> primacy of gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so expresly, that <hi>M. Collins</hi> had no way to answere them, but with a fraudulent silence, and dissimulation of that which most imported, as you haue seene so lately that I need not to repeate it.</p>
            <p n="48">48. Thirdly, you haue seene also how M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath quit himselfe in his answere to my Adioinder, so farre as yet we haue gone, wherein you may haue noted such a number of follyes, absurdityes, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, falsifications, and abuse of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, that you may guesse, with what manner of ware the rest of his great pedlars packe is stuffed; seeing that nothing hath passed from him, of all that which I haue hitherto examined, wherein he hath not beene notably ouertaken: and in one thing specially he surpasseth all other ignorant, and foolish Scriblers of this age (at least those which I haue seene) that he hath not the wit to vnderstand when he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against his aduersary, or against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, whereof you haue seene diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. And therefore I may with great reason say vnto him, for the conclusion of this Chapter, and Controuersy, <hi>Obmutesce Samuel,</hi> for shame, <hi>obmutesce.</hi>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:15521:130"/> debated with M. <hi>Collins</hi> only the matter of the Popes supremacy; and now meaning, in the ensuing Chapters, to treat of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Controuersy, to wit. <hi>Of prayer to Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Veneration of their Relikes,</hi> I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute my first intended course; which is to attend only to the discouery of his coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages &amp; fraudes in his answeres to the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and authorityes of the Fathers allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by me in my Adioynder, whereby I doubt not, but that his bad conscience, &amp; the weaknes of his cause wilbe no lesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident, then if I should discouer all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, which truly are so many in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy, that they would require more tyme, &amp; labour then were fit to be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon such an idle companion; besides that they are commonly so connected with his fraudes, and so euident of themselues, that the discreet Reader will easily note many of thē without any labour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f myne to decypher them, or to put him in mind thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Well then I will beginne with his sixt Chapter, which beginneth his second part about the <hi>Inuocation of Saints</hi> (as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe intytleth it.) And because my first que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion debated with my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> concerning that matter, is about the word
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:15521:130"/>
               <hi>Inuocation,</hi> whether it belong to God alone (as my Lord affirmeth it to do) or may be applyed also to Saints; I will examine <hi>M. Collins</hi> his frauds in answer to my Adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der touching that point.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is therfore to be vnderstood that my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> labouring to proue that none can be <hi>inuocated</hi> but God, sayth: <hi>Terret nos Apostolus &amp;c</hi> the Apostle doth terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy vs, when he asketh this question <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>Quomodo inuocabunt, in quem non crediderunt?</hi> How shal they inuocat him, in whom they beleeued not? Vpon which text he inferreth that we may inuocate none but him in whome we beleeue, which is God alone; wherupon I thought good in my Adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to explicate that text, and to that end, I sayd thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 213. <hi>num.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <q>A man may wonder how this great Doctor could so grossely erre in a matter so euident as this, seeing that the words of the Apostle immediatly going before, do manifestly shew, that he speaketh there of an <hi>Inuocation</hi> due to God alone, as to our chiefe Lord; which kind of <hi>Inuocation</hi> is not communicable to creatures; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle hauing sayd, that God is <hi>Dominus omnium &amp;c.</hi> the Lord of all, &amp; rich, or bountifull, towardes all that inuocate
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:15521:131"/> him, he confirmeth it with the saying of the Prophet, <hi>Omnis qui inuocauerit nomen Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini saluus erit,</hi> euery one that shall inuocate the name of our Lord, shalbe saued. And then he addeth: <hi>Quomodo inuocabunt in quem non crediderunt?</hi> how shal they inuocate him, in whome they haue not belieued? as who would say, how can they inuocate him, of whome the Prophet speaketh, him, that is <hi>Dominus omnium,</hi> the Lord of all, except they belieue in him, that is to say, except they beleeue him to be their Lord, and Creator, whereby he doth not signify that none but God can be inuocated in any sort; but that we cannot inuocate God, as our Lord, and our God, except we belieue him so to be.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus sayd I, and as I hope, this my explication of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> wordes is so naturall, proper, and conforme to the circumstances of the text, that it cannot with reason be reiected. And this <hi>M. Collins</hi> saw so well (as it seemeth) that he thoght best to practise his ordinary fraud in dissembling it wholy, &amp; therfor not making so much as any mentiō of it (as any way controuerted betwixt my Lord and me) he applyeth and vrgeth it in the same sense that my Lord doth, taking occasiō to wrangle with me about another question, to wit, whether we may be sayd
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:15521:131"/> to belieue in Saints (which I will debate with him anone) &amp; because I affirmd that it might be truly sayd, that we beleeue in Saints <hi>in some sort,</hi> and sense, he alleadgeth that text of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> vrging the generality of it, and expounding, <hi>Quomodo inuocabunt in quem,</hi> that is, sayth he, <hi>in quemcumque non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderunt,</hi> how shall they call vpon him, in whomesoeuer they haue not beleeued: which interpretation of his, that other of myne in my Adioynder (gathered and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by me out of the circumstances of the place) doth vtterly ouerthrow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to haue beene answered &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by him, before he grounded any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments or reasons, vpon his owne expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiō, being no other but my Lord of <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesters,</hi> which I impugned, and confuted by myne.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Furthermore I proued also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards out of my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> himself that the word <hi>inuocation</hi> may be applyed to creatures; for he sayth <hi>pag.</hi> 45. §. <hi>locus autem.</hi> That <hi>poscereà sanctis auxilium propriè inuocare est,</hi> to aske help of Saints is properly to inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them; whereupon I sayd in my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder thus <hi>pag.</hi> 215. <hi>num.</hi> 6. <hi>according to this interpretation of his,</hi>
               <q>we do properly inuocate al those of whome we craue help, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:15521:132"/> which we lawfully craue, not only of God, but also of those who by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God may, an do lawfully help vs, as Angells, Saints, and men do: whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it followeth that we may lawfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund their help, and consequently <hi>inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> them, according to M. <hi>Andrewes</hi> his owne interpretation; whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he hath not only very idely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to fright vs with his terrible Text, but also fondly contradicted himself.</q> Thus sayd I, in my Adioynder.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And now I make no doubt, but that thou wilt thinke good Reader, that <hi>M. Collins</hi> ought in reason to haue taken some notice of this, aswell to iustify his owne, &amp; my Lords applicatiō of the word <hi>Inuocation</hi> to God alone, (which heere you see is disproued by my Lords own doctrin) as also to deliuer my Lord from the note of contradiction wherewith I charged him. But he dissembleth all this, albeit he sayth somewhat (as idely as he is wont) to the paragraffs that immediatly go before and after, to wit, to the fifth, and seauenth, wheras this, which I haue now cyted, is in the sixt; so as he cannot be excused neither from a fraudulent dissimulation of my Text, nor from treachery to my Lord,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:15521:132"/> for leauing him in the lurch vndefended, being charged with a flatte Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But now let vs heare how he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth touching the fayth or beliefe which we may be sayd to haue in Saints. First then he sayth, that I acknowledge <hi>the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints (but not of God) to be possible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sayth in them,</hi> and yet he taketh exception to it, because by that distinction, <hi>at least</hi> (sayth he) <hi>a man might inuocate God though not as the Creator of heauen and earth, yet as some Saint, or demy-God;</hi> which how false it is, &amp; how farre from my meaning, you shal see by my owne words after a whyle: in the meane tyme he proceedeth, and sayth that afterwards, I eat my word, and allow <hi>fayth in Saints themselues;</hi> and albeit he confesseth that I qualify it, saying <hi>in some sort,</hi> yet he styleth it <hi>an egregious blasphemy,</hi> &amp; produceth diuers places of holy scripture and Fathers to proue that there can be no fayth but in god; which how little it proueth against me, you shall now see, by my own text, which he fraudently concealeth, and bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth egregiously.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Thus then I said in my Adioynder, touching this poynt <hi>pag.</hi> 214. <hi>num.</hi> 4. <q>
                  <hi>This doth not contradict the inuocation of</hi> Saints in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:15521:133"/> Respect, to wit, not as Gods, but as the seruants of God, whom he glorifieth, and by whose intercession, and mediation he bestoweth graces, and fauours vpon mē: in which sense, yt may also be truly said, that we cannot <hi>inuocate</hi> them, or craue their prayers, except we do <hi>in some sort</hi> beleeue in them (I meane) so farr forth as we <hi>inuocate</hi> them, that is to say, except we beleeue them to be Gods seruants, and that we haue also confidence in them, as in those who by gods goodnes may help vs. So as a fayth, &amp; beleife in saints is necessary for the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, though yt ys not the fayth that we haue in God, as in our cheif Lord and Creator. And that we may haue fayth in Saints <hi>M. Andrews</hi> may learne in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle himself, who commendeth the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and fayth which <hi>Philemon</hi> had <hi>in domino Iesu &amp; in omnes sanctos,</hi> in our Lord Iesus, and in all saynts; vpon which words <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his Commentary vpon that Epistle dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth amply, prouing that wee may be sayd to haue fayth in Saints. Thus said I in my <hi>Adioynder.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Now then herein yt is euident, first that I do distinguish clerely betwixt the fayth that we haue in God (as our Lord and Creatour) and in Saints, as his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15521:133"/> (who by his permission and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, may help and releiue vs) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I say, that we may beleeue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in them, <hi>in some sort.</hi> And this is most true, not only of Saynts, but also of men. For who wilbe so mad to demaund help or releife at any mans hands, who he doth not beleiue, may and will help him? And this also I do say expresly, is not the fayth, and beleife which wee haue in God, as our Lord and Creatour, because wee do not acknowledge the Saynts so to be; wherby you see how friuolous, and vayne the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is which he taketh to my asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when he sayth, that by my distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a man may <hi>inuocate God, at least, as some Saynt or demy-God, though not as Creatour of heauen and earth;</hi> whereas I doe expressely affirme, that aswell <hi>Inuocation,</hi> as <hi>Fayth</hi> is due to God in a supreme, and peculiar mā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not cōmunicable to any creatures, to wit, as vniuersall Lord, and Creatour of all, which therefore cannot be so extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as to be the honour of a Saint, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-God.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Secondly it appeareth that the texts of holy scripture and the places of the ancient Fathers which he bringeth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, that fayth can haue no other obiect but
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:15521:134"/> God, do proue nothing against me, who do clearely distinguish betwixt fayth in God, and fayth in Saints; wherof the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is properly fayth, hauing only Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God for obiect, as he is <hi>prima veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas;</hi> whereas the fayth in Saints, I sayd is fayth <hi>in some sort,</hi> implying only a beleif and confidence, that they may help vs by the goodnes of God, whose seruants they are. And therfore yt is manifest, that he hath abused me notably, not only in concealing and dissembling my discourse, but also in misconstruing, and peruerting it most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously &amp; arguing against his owne false sense, and construction of it, as if it were myne, as you haue seene him doe many tymes heretofore, and shall see euen now againe in his next Answer to the instance which I brought out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi> and <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> exposition therof. Thus then he sayth <hi>pag.</hi> 226. <hi>num.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>He belyes S. Hieromes commentary vpon the Epistle to Philemon, who speakes of no fayth to be reposed in Saints, but credence giuen to their doctrine only.</hi> So he, belying <hi>S. Hierome</hi> manifestly in two things (besides his lye touching me, when he sayth, that I bely <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.) For <hi>S. Hierome</hi> expounding those words of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon, audiens charitatem
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:15521:134"/> tuam &amp; fidē quam habes in Domino Iesu, &amp; omnes sanctos eius &amp;c.</hi> saith, that there is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to interpret that which <hi>S. Paul</hi> said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Philemons</hi> Charity, <hi>which he had in Christ Iesus, and in all his Saints;</hi> but that the difficulty consisted in the interpretation of that which belongeth to his Fayth in Christ, and in his Saynts, and therefore he saith thus.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Non hoc quaeritur, quomodo camdem fidem in Christo Iesu habere quis possit, &amp; in Sanctos eius,</hi> nor the question is how a man may haue the same faith in Christ Iesus, &amp; his Saints: wherein I must desire M. <hi>Collins</hi> to note by the way, that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> makes the question heere not of some kind of fayth, or of fayth <hi>in some sort,</hi> that may be had in Saints (as I spake reseruedly) but of the same fayth, which we haue in Christ, how that may be also had in Saints, to which purpose S. <hi>Hierome</hi> also sayth further thus: <hi>Ad expositio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem huius loci &amp;c.</hi> For the exposition of this place, let vs take an example out of <hi>Exodus, Credidit populus Deo &amp; Moysi seruo eius; vna at{que} eadem credulitas in Moysen refertur, &amp; in Deum,</hi> the people belieued God and Moyses his seruant; one and the selfe same credulity or fayth is referred to Moyses, and to God, <hi>vt populus qui credebat in Dominum, aeque credidisse di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:15521:135"/> in seruum,</hi> that the people which belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Lord, may be sayd to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued aswel in the seruant; <hi>hoc autem non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in Moyse &amp;c.</hi> and this to be vnderstood, not only in <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ses,</hi> but in al his Saints. Thus sayth <hi>S. Hierome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. Wherby it is as cleare as the Sunne, that <hi>M. Collins</hi> belyeth him grossely, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he speakes of no fayth to be repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Saints, when he speaketh not only of some fayth, but also of the same fayth, that we haue in God, and in Christ Iesus; and albeit he explicateth how we may be sayd to haue fayth in Saints, yet he doth not deny that is the same fayth which we haue in God, but confirmeth it (not onely with that place of <hi>Exodus</hi> before mentioned but also) by the like consideration to be had of Charity, or loue to the Saints, or seruants of God (which is the same loue with the which we loue God, because we loue them for God) and therefore he sayth, that <hi>non est in Deum perfecta dilectio &amp; fides, quae in ministres eius odio &amp; infidelitate tenuatur,</hi> the loue and fayth in God, is not perfect, which is exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated with hatred, and infidelity towards his seruants; giuing to vnderstand, that as we loue Gods seruāts, for the loue we beare to God, so also we may be sayd to belieue
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:15521:135"/> in Gods seruants, for the fayth we haue in God; &amp; as we do not loue God, if we loue not his seruants, so also it may be sayd, that we do not belieue in God, when we doe not belieue in his seruants.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And although he also explicateth this, yet his explication doth further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that it is the same fayth which we haue in God; for thus he sayth: <hi>Hoc quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co tale est &amp;c. This which I say, is in this manner, or thus to be vnderstood. Doth a man belieue in God the Creatour? He cannot belieue in him except he first belieue that all thinges which are written in the Scriptures of his Saints, are true.</hi> So he. And then exemplifyeth the same by the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> by the translation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> by the deliuery of <hi>Noë</hi> from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, by the departure of <hi>Abraham</hi> from his countrey and kindred, by the oblation of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and many other particuler historyes, in the bookes of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Kinges,</hi> and concludeth thus: <hi>Haec &amp; caetera quae de Sanctis scripta sunt nisi quis vniuersa crediderit &amp;c.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a man belieue al this, and all the other thinges which are written of the Saints, he cannot belieue in the God of Saints. Thus sayth <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and the reason heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, because God, who is Verity it selfe, &amp; the Author of the Scriptures, is the obiect
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:15521:136"/> of our fayth, and therefore he that doth not belieue what God hath reuealed in his Scriptures concerning his Saints, doth not belieue in God.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And this also <hi>S. Hierome</hi> doth yet further confirme by the sanctity which is in God, and in his seruants, affirming it to be <hi>candem sanctitatem,</hi> the selfe same sanctity (meaning no doubt that our sanctity is a participation of the diuine sanctity) and then he sayth finally of <hi>Philemon: Non pute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus leuem esse Philemonis praedicationem &amp;c.</hi> Let vs not thinke, that it is a light, or small praise of Philemon, <hi>si eamdem habet Sanctos fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, quam &amp; in Deum,</hi> if he had the same fayth in the Saints of holy men, which he had in God. So he. Loe then how cleare it is, that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> teacheth expresly, that we may be sayd to haue, not onely some kind of fayth in Saints, but also the same fayth that vve haue in God, wherein also it is to be noted, that there is not so much as one word of belieuing the doctrine of Saints, whereof <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayth <hi>S. Hierome</hi> speaketh only, albeit afterwards he is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aduised, saying that <hi>S. Hierome o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly meant that the historyes which went of the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were to be belieued, and credited.</hi> And if <hi>S. Hierome</hi> meant so, yea, and only so, then
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:15521:136"/> truly he meant not (as <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayd before) only that credence is to be giuen to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Saints, for he could not mean them both, and yet but one of them only, and much lesse both this only, &amp; that only; so as we shall haue some what a do to agree this poore fellovv with himselfe, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing, that hauing sayd in his text (as you haue heard) that S. <hi>Hierome meant only, that credence is to be giuen to the doctrine of the Saints,</hi> he contradicteth the same with a marginall note iust ouer against it, contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some part of S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> text, set down by me before, signifying that a man cannot belieue in God the Creatour, except he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that those thinges are true which are written in Scripture of the Saints, as of the creation of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Whereby it is manifest euen by <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> owne wordes, that his only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was not, <hi>that credence should be giuen to the doctrine of Saints:</hi> for put the case he had sayd (as he doth not any where) that it is to be vnderstood by fayth in Saints, that their doctrine is to be belieued, yet it could not be vnderstood, that he meant so only, because he sayth expresly that he meant it of credence to be giuen to the verity of the Scriptures concerning Saints: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:15521:137"/>
               <hi>M. Collins,</hi> concludeth his note in the margēt, with this question to me, <hi>VVher is conscience now M. F. T?</hi> wheras I may rather aske him, Where is both conscience, and wit now <hi>M. Collins?</hi> For truely if he had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both, he would not contradict his text with his marginall note, and besides make no lesse then three notable lyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the space of three lines.</p>
            <p n="18">18. For first, wheras he sayth, that I belyed S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> commentary in my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder, you see how false it is, seeing all that I say of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is, that <hi>he discourseth amply vpon</hi> S. Pauls <hi>wordes, prouing that we may be sayd to haue fayth in Saints,</hi> which is most true, as you haue seene; for he teacheth not only that we may haue fayth in them, but also the same fayth, which we haue in Christ; and what blasphemy would this haue seemed to <hi>M. Collins,</hi> if I had sayd it, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he accoūteth it an <hi>egregious blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> in me to say only, that we may be sayd to haue fayth in Saints <hi>in some sort,</hi> which I also explicated immediatly to consist in a beliefe, and confidence that they may help vs (as the seruants of God) and I added fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this is not the fayth, which we haue in God, as in our Lord, and Creator; besides that, it is to be noted, that I do not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:15521:137"/> alleadge <hi>S. Hierome</hi> to proue or confirme my explication of the manner, how we may be sayd to haue fayth in Saints, because I knew full well, that it may be sayd in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers respects (as it may appeare by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers expositions of the Apostles wordes to <hi>Philemon,</hi> &amp; M. <hi>Collins</hi> himselfe setteth down one out of <hi>Haymo</hi> different from that of S. <hi>Hierome;</hi>) but I affirmed only that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> proueth amply out of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> words to <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,</hi> that we may be sayd to haue fayth in Saints, which you see is so true &amp; euident, that it is extreme impudency in <hi>M. Collins</hi> to deny it; and therefore I hope it may passe for a notable lye, that he chargeth me to haue belyed S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> Commentary.</p>
            <p n="19">19. His second lye is, in saying that S. <hi>Hierome speaks of no fayth to be reposed in Saints,</hi> wheras he speaketh expresly and amply of some fayth, yea of the same fayth we haue in Christ.</p>
            <p n="20">20. His third lye is, that he affirmeth that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> speakes only <hi>of credence to be giuen to the doctrine of Saints,</hi> whereas he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not one word of it, and much lesse only of it. And now add heerto his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of himselfe in affirming that <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> speaketh of two seuerall thinges with an <hi>only</hi> to both (which cannot possibly be
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:15521:138"/> true of both; for if he speake <hi>only</hi> of the one, the other must needs be excluded,) let this, I say, be added to his three lyes, and to his ordinary dissimulation, and false constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my text, and it wilbe euident that he hath neither conscience, shame, nor wit, in so much that if he vseth to talke, no more wisely then he writeth, it may be wondred that some body hath not begged him ere this to get his liuings, which they say are great; and not vnlike, for as the old Prouerbe sayth, <hi>fortuna fauet fatuis:</hi> but this shall suffice for this point, and now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p n="21">21. <hi>M. Collins</hi> doth admonish vs in the title of his sixth Chapter, about the <hi>Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, that the Authorityes of the Fathers of the first and second rancke (according to the Bishops accurate diuisiō of the confused huddle brought by the Cardinall) are examined</hi> (for so speaketh very accuratly and pretily fine M. <hi>Collins</hi>) &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the end you may know, what the <hi>accurate diuision of the Cardinalls confused huddle is,</hi> and what he meaneth by the first &amp; second Ranke of Fathers; you shal vnderstand that my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> vndertaking to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the places of the Fathers alleadged by Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> touching the <hi>inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints,</hi> deuideth them into three ranks

            <p n="22">22. Thus indeed sayth my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> more <hi>accurately</hi> (to vse <hi>M.

            <p n="23">23. In the first rancke of the Fathers, which my Lord of <hi>VVincester</hi> sayth, <hi>are truly Fathers, but not truly cyted,</hi> the first was S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil,</hi> out of whose oration vpon the 40.

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:15521:139"/> sense of the Greek, though the words do differ; and for the confirmation thereof, and the proofe that <hi>S.

            <p n="32">32. But let vs now passe further, and see some more of his cozening tricks in the defence of another answere of my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> to the place of S. <hi>Basil</hi> before mē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>num.</hi> 23. alleadged by the Cardinall out of his Oration vpon the 40.

            <p n="33">33. <q>Now to say somewhat of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answere which I mentioned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:15521:143"/> he sayth, <hi>Aliud est narrare quid fiat, aliud statuere quid faciendum sit:</hi> it is one thing to declare what is done, and another thing to determine what should be done; giuing to vnderstand that albeit S. <hi>Basil</hi> in the place alleadged by the Cardinall declared that men vsed in his tyme to pray to Saints, yet the same doth not suffice to proue it to be lawful, except it be approued by some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>S.

But heere I would be glad to know what kind of <hi>statute</hi> or <hi>decree</hi> he would haue in this question; for if he exact some decree of the Fathers assembled in a General or Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Councell, he flyeth, as I may say, out of the lists, to another manner of tryall thē the Cardinal offereth in this place, &amp; then he himselfe seemeth to accept. Besides that he must expect such decrees frō the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>omes of the Councels, where they are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly related, and not from the workes of the Fathers, who are not wont to set them downe, but vpon particuler occasions, now and then occurring.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="34">34. <q>To which purpose it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:15521:144"/> that there were neuer any Coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells assembled, or Synodicall statutes made concerning fayth, but by reason of matters controuerted with publicke trouble, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and danger to the Church; as the foure first generall Councells were called by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the heresyes of the <hi>Arians, Macedonians, Nestorians,</hi> and <hi>Eutychians,</hi> which at those dayes did exceedingly molest, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize all the East Church; whereas the Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints being then publikely, and generally practised throughout the whole Church needed not to be confirmed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Synods, especially seeing it was not expresly denyed by any at that tyme. For albeit an abominable <hi>Arian</hi> Heretike called <hi>Eustachius</hi> did then impugne the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike honour done to Saints, by dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches to them, &amp; celebrating their feasts (for which cause a prouincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was held at <hi>Gangra,</hi> where this his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy, togeather with diuers others of his, was condemned, and all those <hi>anathematized</hi> who did contemne the Temples, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of Martyrs, and the assemblyes, &amp; sacred oblatiōs which were made there) yet because this Heretike did not directly impugne the inuocation of Saints, the same was not directly, and expresly confirmed,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:15521:144"/> or mentioned in this Canon.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="35">35. Thus sayd I in my Adionder. And now that you may fully know the state of the questiō betwixt him &amp; me in this place and iudge therby the better of his fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent answere, you shall vnderstand, that whereas I haue sayd heere to my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> that if he exact a decree of some generall, or prouinciall Councell for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Saints, in <hi>S. Basils</hi> tyme, he runneth out of the lists, to another manner of tryall then the Cardinall offereth; the reason is, because the Cardinall vndertooke only to proue by the testimony of the Fathers of the first 400. or 500. yeares, that the fayth of the Protestants touching the <hi>Inuocation</hi> of Saints, is not the fayth of the old Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church.</p>
            <p n="36">36. This appeareth euidently by the Cardinals owne words of his Apology <hi>pag.</hi> 11. §. <hi>Sequitur,</hi> where hauing signifyed that his Maiesty in his Preface admitted the three Creeds, the 4. first generall Councells and the vniforme doctrine of the first 400. (or as it is in the English copy 500. yeares) he declareth that amongst other points of Catholike Religion, his Maiesty condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth prayer to Saints, and the veneration of Reliques, as superstitious: Whereupon
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:15521:145"/> the Cardinall sayth: <hi>Accipiam intercessionem Sanctorum &amp;c. I will take in hand the intercession of Saints, with the veneration of Reliques; which if I can shew to be approued by the vnanime consent of the Fathers of the first</hi> 400. <hi>or</hi> 500. <hi>yeares, I shall withall proue, that the fayth of the King of England is not the fayth of the Primitiue Church, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, and heresies of the late Innouatours.</hi> Thus sayth the Cardinall. Where it is cleare, that my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> demanding a decree of the Fathers, for prayer to Saints, within the first 400. or 500. yeares, flyeth from the tryall which the Cardinall offereth, and my Lord ought to accept, and stand vnto, seeing his Maiesty admitteth it, whom my Lord hath vndertaken, and is bound to defend.</p>
            <p n="37">37. This being so, let vs now see, what M. <hi>Collins</hi> answereth to my Adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his 229. <hi>pag.</hi> and 9. §. wherein he iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleth notably, not only in dissembling my text (which you see is ordinary with him) but also in wresting the sense &amp; substance of it to far other purpose then euer I meant it, or can be any way gathered of it. Thus then he sayth of me. He sayes, <q>
                  <hi>There is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, or no decree, but in Councells.</hi> Let him bring them hardly then, let him cyte the Councels. Are not they Fathers, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:15521:145"/> Fathers? Wil his Maiesty refuse the Councells, wherin so many speake as one man, that is content to be ordered by the Fathers in singular, if the authority be pregnant, &amp; the antiquity sufficient?</q> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="38">38. And now iudge, good Reader, how substantially he hath answered. I tell him that there needed no Canons of Coūcels for praying to saints at that tyme, yea and that there could be none, because the practise of it was then vniuersall, and there had not beene any such Controuersy or trouble in the Church about that point, that it might cause any decrees or Canons to be made cōcerning the same; &amp; yet he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grauely bids me bring thē hardly then. <q>Besides that, affirming as he doth, that his Maiesty is content to be ordered by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in singular, if their Authority be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant, and Antiquity sufficient; he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that which moued the Cardinall to produce the testimonyes of S. <hi>Basil,</hi>
               </q> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers of the first 500. yeares (to wit because his Maiesty did admit them) in which respect my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> was also bound to stand vnto them, seeing he vndertooke to answere for his Maiesty; &amp; therefore I had reason to charge him to fly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:15521:146"/> out of the lists, when he fled from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonyes of the Fathers, to the decrees of Councells; but M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath thought best to conceale all this, and as though I had sayd nothing to the purpose, vrgeth me (as my Lord did the Cardinal) to produce som Canons or Decrees. Can there be greater iuggling then this? Yet this is nothing to that which followeth.</p>
            <p n="39">39. <q>He goeth on in the same Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graf, saying thus of me. But how shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does he belye the Councell of <hi>Gangra?</hi> Neither is there any such thing in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eme there, nor yet in the Canons. Only a corruption is crept into the Proem, which is nothing material neither, though it wer graunted. See the greeke at <hi>Paris,</hi> of <hi>Tilius</hi> his edition, see the greeke copies. And is to meet at Churches, or not to shunne assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes in <hi>Basilicis Martyrū,</hi> all one with the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of Saints,</hi> now become? Why should we not rather thinke their priuate Masse cōdemned vnder a Priest, &amp; his boy in the 6 Canon of that Councell?</q> Thus saith he, and then goeth forward, most idly, cyting 6. or 7. Canons more of that Councell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some other points of the Catholike Religion, being stale obiections, which haue been answered ouer and ouer by our
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:15521:146"/> writers, and proued no way to concerne vs, as he may see in Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> or any other Catholike Author, that wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of these Controuersies; for which cause I omit to answere him concerning them, as also because I haue resolued not to deale in this Chapter with his fooleryes, and by-questions (as these are) but only to discouer his fraudes, falsities, and lyes.</p>
            <p n="40">40. And therefore now to come to the discouery of this: you haue seene heer first that he doth not set down any one word of my text cōcerning that Councel of <hi>Gangra:</hi> secondly, that because I quote in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent the Proeme of that Councell, and the 20. Canon, he sayth, that there is a corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion crept into the Proeme, thogh nothing materiall; and for the proofe heereof, he posts vs ouer to <hi>Paris</hi> to see the Greek there, without telling vs what the corruption is, or wherein it consisteth. Lastly he insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that I alleadge this Councell to proue prayer to Saints, saying, <hi>Is to meete in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or not shunne assemblyes</hi> in Basilicis Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>all one with the inuocation of Saints now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</hi> So he. And afterwards again more plainly: <hi>And do they tell vs,</hi> sayth he, <hi>of the Coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of</hi> Gangra, <hi>in which there is not one sillable, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in preface, nor bulke of praying to Saints?</hi> Thus
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:15521:147"/> sayth he, as if I cyted it to proue prayer to Saints.</p>
            <p n="41">41. Now then let vs see, who hath lyed shamefully, I or he; I said that the Fathers in that Councel did anathematize all those who contemned the monuments of Martyrs, and the assemblies, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oblations which were made there. This is euident in the 20. Canon which is this: <hi>Si quis arrogantia v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e) the holy rites which are cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated there, and the memoryes of them, let him be accursed. Thus sayth that Canō, wherto <hi>M Collins</hi> taketh no exception, and therefore it sufficeth alone to iustify my assertion, and condemne him of a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous lye, in saying, that I do shamefully bely the Councell of <hi>Gangra;</hi> wheras I say no more of it, then that which is found there expresly in the 20. Canon. And wheras he sayth that there is no such thing in the Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me nor yet in the Canons; if he meane, by no such thing, that there is
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:15521:147"/> nothing there touching the celebration of the feasts, &amp; memoryes of Martyrs (which was all that I affirmed) it is also a lye, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse monstrous then the former. And if he say that he meant it only of prayer to saints (as that there is no such thing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell) albeit he say true in that respect, yet he belyeth me shamefully in another, &amp; coze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his Reader intollerably, affirming that I alleadge that Councell to proue prayer to Saints, wheras I signify the contrary in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse words saying, <hi>that because Eustachius did not directly impugne the Inuocation of Saints, the same was not directly confirmed, or mentioned in that Councell.</hi> Behould then what an impudent fellow this is, who to proue one lye in me, maketh no lesse then two or three himself, as also you see he did the like before, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging me most falsely to haue belyed Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> Commentary, when he himselfe made no lesse then three euident lyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three lynes: so as if he come at any tyme where there is lying for the whetstone, it wilbe his infallibly; for I thinke he will hardly meet with his match in that faculty.</p>

And forasmuch as <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath also here (as he is wont) dissembled my whole text, and only picked out of it heere and there a word or two, to carp at, I must be forced as I haue been diuers tymes, to lay down the words of my <hi>Adioynder,</hi> concerning so much of this matter, as I meane to bebate with him, that is, so much as toucheth the fraud, that both he and my Lord haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein.

            <p n="43">43. <q>Now let vs see what he sayth to the second ranke of Fathers, which he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to be truly cyted, but not to be of sound credit. The first of these is Saint <hi>Ephram,</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:15521:149"/> out of whom the Cardinal alleadgeth these words: <hi>Precamur beatissimi Martyres &amp;c. we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you most blessed Martyrs, that you will vouchsafe to pray vnto our Lord for vs wretched sinners, that the grace of Christ may come vnto vs.</hi> To this <hi>M. Andrews</hi> answereth diuers wayes: first he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth exception against the translation; both because the Author thereof was one of ours (whose fidelity and credit he saith hath beene long since cracked) and also because the originall (which is in greek) was, saith he, lately taken out of a grot, and therefore is <hi>fidei cripticae,</hi> of obscure cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. So it pleaseth him to make himselfe merry with the word <hi>Crypta,</hi> for that <hi>Vossius</hi> the translatour signifieth in his Epistle to the Reader in the beginning of the first Tome that he had a speciall help for his translation, by two very auncient manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts or written copyes of Saint <hi>Ephraems</hi> works, which are to be seene in <hi>Crypta fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata</hi> (a famous monastery neer to <hi>Rome</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led commonly in Italian <hi>Grotta ferrata</hi>) of which manuscripts the one was written in the yeare of our Lord 531.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="44">44. <q>But what cause had <hi>M. Andrews</hi> to iest at this? Sure I am that in the iudgment of any indifferent man, it may serue for no smal iustification of the translatour that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:15521:150"/> he fortifyeth his translation with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of such an auncient manuscript, written aboue eleuen hundred yeares ago, and yet extant to be seene so neere to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Tomes were printed, especially seeing that there is such continuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and confluence thither from <hi>Rome</hi> (by reason of the celebrity of that mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery) that he might well think he should quickly be discouered for an impudent, &amp; notable lyar, in case he should faygne the same. And therefore for his further iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in this poynt, he also directeth his Reader to the very classe where the said manuscripts are, to be found in the library of <hi>Grotta ferrata,</hi> to wit, vnder the title of these Greeke letters Ω. and Π. Besydes that he declareth also further that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the same copyes with diuers others which he saw, and are yet to be seene in the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the library of Cardinall <hi>Sforza.</hi>

For albeyt he say; that Catholikes haue lost their credit in matters of that kinde; yet I hope the discreet Reader (who hath already seene by many examples how little credit M.

Do you see then how idlely he tatleth, and what strang newes he tells me? to wit, that <hi>Ephraems</hi> works are distinguished by Tomes, as if I doubted of it, when I tould him so expresly my selfe, saying also that there are three Tomes of them, translated, and set forth by <hi>Vossius?</hi> Do you thinke this fellow is well in his wits?</p>
            <p n="49">49. But you will say, that he taketh exception to those Tomes, as being <hi>cripticae fidei.</hi> It is true indeed, for so he doth; but why then doth he not tell vs some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the true tomes of true <hi>Ephraem</hi> which my Lord quoted, and he acknowledgeth? Why then doth he not tell vs who transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, or who set them forth, or where they were printed, or where they are to be found, if they be not those of <hi>Vossius,</hi> which is the matter in question betwixt my Lord and me; for his Lordship cyteth the first Tome of a true <hi>Ephraem,</hi> and I tell him that there are none but the three tomes set forth by <hi>Vossius,</hi> and desire to heare newes of the other if there be any such. And now <hi>M. Collins</hi> tells me newes, of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Ephraem</hi> distinguished by Tomes,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:15521:153"/> whereof he saith I cannot be ignorant: so as by that reason be meaneth the Tomes set forth by <hi>Vossius,</hi> for I tould him before, and so I tell him stil, that I know no other (neither can he in truth meane any other, because there are no other extant) whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it should follow also that the first tome which my Lord quoted should be the first of those three before mentioned; which neuerthelesse, both my Lord, and he do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect as being <hi>cripticae fidei.</hi> So as you see how distractedly he talketh contradicting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and my Lord, except he can tell me of some other edition of S. <hi>Ephraems</hi> works deuided into Tomes then that of <hi>Vossius,</hi> which yet he neither doth, nor euer shallbe able to do.</p>
            <p n="50">50. But will you see how he defendeth my Lord, or rather how he payeth him home, in that which followeth: <hi>The Bishop</hi> (sayth he) <hi>was not only true in quoting</hi> Ephrem, <hi>but quoted him out of the originall Arabique that he wrote in. Not in coggery therefore as you call it, but so much the more to be respected, and credited afore your</hi> grottae, <hi>or</hi> criptae. So he. And is it so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed M. <hi>Collins?</hi> Did the Bishop (as you call him) quote S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> out of the originall <hi>Arabique</hi> wherein he wrote? Ergo not out of the first tome of <hi>Ephraem,</hi> as his Lordship ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:15521:153"/> affirmed; for his works are not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, neither are there any manuscripts of them but in Greeke; for ought I could euer find or heare. And wheras <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayth that he wrote in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, it is more I thinke, then he can proue, or is probable, seeing he was a <hi>Syrian</hi> borne, and therefore it is most like, that he wrote in the <hi>Syriacke</hi> tongue, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some of his workes, or perhaps all may haue beene translated into the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue. But it litle importeth for my Lords excuse in what language he wrote, seeing that the allegation of the place, euen out of the <hi>Arabique,</hi> whence my Lord professeth to take it, is fraudulēt aboue measure, as it shal appeare euen by the <hi>Arabique</hi> words, which M. <hi>Collins</hi> setteth downe, giuen him by my Lord himselfe for his iustification in this point. Thus then he sayth <hi>pag.</hi> 242. <hi>num.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p n="51">51. <hi>You aske the Bishop who published</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrem, <hi>how many Tomes of him &amp;c. in which matter we are not scrupulous to shape you an answer to the full, though it were more that you asked: Of Tomes before.</hi> So he.

Thus sayth <hi>M.

            <p n="52">52. You shall therefore vnderstand, that albeit I know not how my Lords text
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:15521:154"/> is in his manuscript (which M. <hi>Collins</hi> sayth his Lordship keepeth to shew vpon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) yet sure I am, that in the booke, which he calleth the <hi>Diurnall of the Maronites,</hi> printed at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 1584. I find it farre otherwise, both in wordes and sense; for whereas he alleadgeth the <hi>Arabique</hi> wordes thus: <hi>Illaica we shaueca lam atlabu,</hi> the three first are not in the <hi>Arabique</hi> text of S. <hi>Ephraems</hi> prayer, in the aforesayd diurnal of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronits mentioned by <hi>M. Collins,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seemeth, that because <hi>Illaica</hi> or rather <hi>Ellaica</hi> signifyeth <hi>ad te:</hi> my Lord thought best to adde it to the <hi>Arabique</hi> text, to iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his former translation in his answere to the apology, where he hath the Latin thus: <hi>Ad te, ad, praeter te, neminem facio orationem,</hi> and as for the other two words, to wit, <hi>we sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueca,</hi> the former, as it is there placed before <hi>shaueca,</hi> hath no sense, neither serueth to any purpose; for albeit <hi>u.</hi> (which signifyeth, <hi>and</hi>) is pronounced, <hi>uue,</hi> when the word following beginneth with the vowell <hi>e.</hi> (as it is also pronoūced <hi>uua,</hi> when the vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell <hi>a.</hi> followeth immediatly) yet going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a word beginning with a consonant (as it doth heer before <hi>shaueca</hi>) it is not chā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged any way in sound or pronunciation; and therfore it reteyneth the natural sound
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:15521:155"/> and forme of the letter <hi>u.</hi> so as <hi>uue</hi> before <hi>shaueca</hi> hath no sense, or cōstruction: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeareth, either that <hi>M.

In the meane tyme thou shalt vnderstand good Reader, that to the end I may speake vpon good ground, I haue vsed extraordinary diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to find out the sayd <hi>Diuinall,</hi> and to see, and consider the wordes, and text it selfe with the aduise and iudgment not only of some Italians who haue very exact skill in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, but also of the <hi>Maronits</hi> themselues, who doe naturally speake that language, and reside in the College of that Nation heere in Rome, in whole library I found the booke mentioned by <hi>M. Collins,</hi> printed in the yeare 1534. in the <hi>Arabique</hi> tongue, thogh in <hi>Syriac</hi> Caracters: in which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:15521:155"/> booke I find also the whole passage, which <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath layd downe (for he cyteth 7. or 8. lines togeather, as you shall heare further after a while) all agreeing very wel with this printed copy, except only those few wordes which most concerne this Controuersy, and a few more immediatly following left out by him, because (belike) they made nothing for his purpose.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Therefore to the end, as well the truth as my Lords fraud and his champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may the better appeare, I will first set downe the whole text of S. <hi>Ephraem,</hi> as <hi>M. Collins</hi> cyteth, &amp; trāslateth it, &amp; afterwards I will shew the difference betwixt that, &amp; the true <hi>Arabique,</hi> as it is in the printed book which <hi>M. Collins</hi> mētioneth. Thus he sayth: <hi>The words before, and after are these:</hi> Accipe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precationem meam o Domine &amp;c. <hi>Receaue my prayer, O Lord, not for my righteousnes, but for thy mercyes sakes; and in the multitude of thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and of thy compassions, saue my soule, which is taken prisoner of death. Remember me o Lord, and although I haue sinned, and am wounded with deadly wounds,</hi> non precor quemquam praeter te, <hi>yet do I not pray to any besides thy selfe: but to thy mercy and bounty I betake my selfe, because thou art that Lord God which comprisest (or imbracest) all thinges, and thy power is ouer all that liueth and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:15521:156"/> breatheth.</hi> Thus doth <hi>M. Collins</hi> alleadge the context with the circūstances of the place cyted by my Lord.</p>
            <p n="54">54. And indeed the <hi>Arabique</hi> agreeth therewith, vntill it come to the wordes, <hi>Non precor quemquam praeter te,</hi> I do not pray to any besids thy selfe, which are farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the <hi>Arabique</hi> thus, <hi>Flam et lob suaca,</hi> that is to say, <hi>non precabor equalem tibi,</hi> I will not pray to any equall to thee: which <hi>Saint Ephraem</hi> explicateth also further, saying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly thus, <hi>Vlam absot idai ala alah gairaca,</hi> that is to say in English, <hi>And I will not stretch forth my handes to any God, besides thee,</hi> which last sentence is wholy left out by <hi>M. Collins;</hi> so as if we add the same to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which my Lord alleadgeth, &amp; change <hi>praeter te,</hi> besides thee, into <hi>equalem tibi,</hi> equal to thee, it wilbe euident that S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> did not meane to exclude prayer to any, but to the false Gods; for then the whole sentence wilbe this, <hi>I will not pray to any equall to thee, neither will I extēd</hi> (or stretch forth) <hi>my hands to any God besides thee.</hi> And then he goeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath it thus: <hi>But to thy mercy, and bounty I betake my selfe &amp;c.</hi> This then being so, I leaues it to the Reader to iudge, how well <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath iustifyed my Lords allegation; seeing that now it
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:15521:156"/> falleth out, that as his Lordship did then corruptly translate those wordes, <hi>praeter te</hi> insted of <hi>aequalem tibi;</hi> so now <hi>Maister Collins</hi> hath fraudulently alleadged the whole passage, leauing out that which immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely followed, and is very necessary to make the Reader vnderstand Saint <hi>Ephrems</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therein.</p>
            <p n="55">55. And whereas all the controuersy concerning this sentence consisteth in the words, <hi>praeter te,</hi> as whether the same be truely translated out of the <hi>Arabicque;</hi> it is to be vnderstood that the word <hi>shaueca,</hi> which <hi>M. Colins</hi> giueth vs to signify <hi>praeter te,</hi> is no <hi>Arabique</hi> word, as I haue said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although it commeth neere to the <hi>Arabicque;</hi> for the true <hi>Arabicque</hi> word which is in Saint <hi>Ephrems</hi> Text, is <hi>suaca,</hi> and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>equalem tibi,</hi> equall to thee; for <hi>sua</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth equall, and <hi>ca</hi> being added vnto it, maketh it, equall to thee: and for the proofe thereof it chaunced, that an <hi>Italian</hi> very learned in the language being demaū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what <hi>suaca</hi> signified, and hauing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that it signified <hi>equalis tibi,</hi> called to him to a <hi>Maronite</hi> who passed by at the same tyme, and asked him, what signified <hi>equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> in his language, &amp; he answered <hi>suae,</hi> and being further asked what is <hi>equalis tibi,</hi> he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:15521:157"/> said <hi>suaca,</hi> besides that the very Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Hebrew, Syriake,</hi> and <hi>Arabicke</hi> do clearly confirme it, as the <hi>Lexicon pentaglotton col.</hi> 182. <hi>a.</hi> where it apeares that the hebrew verbe <hi>shaua</hi> (which signifyeth <hi>aequalis suit</hi>) is in the <hi>Calday</hi> also <hi>shaua,</hi> in the <hi>Syriaque sheua,</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Arabique saui,</hi> and that it hath for the nowne in the <hi>Hebrew sheua,</hi> in the <hi>Calday shaua,</hi> in the <hi>Syriaque sheui,</hi> and in the <hi>Arabique sua,</hi> all signifying <hi>aequalis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="56">56. Now then by the consonance, &amp; conformity of the other three languages, <hi>Hebrew, Calday,</hi> and <hi>Syriaque,</hi> with the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique,</hi> it is euident that the proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall signification of <hi>sua</hi> in the <hi>Arabique,</hi> is <hi>aequalis;</hi> neuertheles I will not deny but that it is taken sometymes (though vnproperly) for <hi>praeter:</hi> but why my Lord should leaue the proper, and common signification of the word, to take the vnproper, I see no re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>son, especially seeing that <hi>gairaca</hi> which followeth a little after in the <hi>Arabique</hi> Text of <hi>S.

Collins</hi> left out, to wit, <hi>Non extendam manus meas ad Deum pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter te,</hi> I will not extend my hands to a God besides thee. There I say, <hi>praeter te,</hi> is <hi>gairaca</hi> in the <hi>Arabique,</hi> and therfore it is likely that if <hi>S. Ephraem</hi> had meant to say, <hi>Non precor quē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:15521:157"/> praeter te,</hi> he would not haue vsed <hi>suaca,</hi> but <hi>gairaca,</hi> as he did afterwards.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:15521:158"/> it is manifest, that his corruption of <hi>S. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraem</hi> is inexcusable as well for the text, as for the sense,</p>
            <p n="57">57. But now to do my Lord, and M. <hi>Collins</hi> a pleasure, if I should allow their trā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of <hi>praeter te,</hi> what would they gaine therby? Truely nothing at all, for now that we see the circumstances laid downe by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> it appeareth euidently that my Lord did fraudulently cyte those words of <hi>S. Ephraem,</hi> concealing the sayd circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to the end he might with more colour apply them to his purpose against prayer to Saints, which is no way preiudiced therby for the circumstances do shew that <hi>S.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Omnipotent Lord of all, who only can giue grace, remission of sinne, and saluation; so as <hi>S. Ephraem</hi> had great reason to craue it of him only, and therefore might well haue sayd, <hi>non precor quemquam praeter te,</hi> I do not pray to any but to thee, that is to say, to obtayne remission of my sinnes, not knowing any equall to thee, or any other God but thee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to thy only mercy, and bounty I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:15521:158"/> my selfe, because thou art the Lord God of all, &amp; hast power ouer all creaturs. Thus I say, S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> might with great reason say, and so all Catholikes in like case, neuer demanding grace, or remission of sinnes, or saluation of any but of God himselfe, who is the only giuer thereof; albeit we craue the same of him by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession of Saints, and of men; and do also beseech Saints, and men to help vs to obtayne it of him, yea and pray also to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and Saints to fauour, and help vs in such other things as by the goodnes of God are in their power to bestow vpon vs, but not as Gods, or <hi>equall to God,</hi> but as his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest seruants, and fauorits, whose ministery and seruice he vseth to the help and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his Creatures; so as to that purpose which S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> prayed, we pray to none but to God.</p>
            <p n="58">58. You see then what good seruice, <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath done vnto my Lord heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, laying downe the text of S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> at large, seeing it appeareth euidently therby that my Lords allegation of those few words which he cyted, was very fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: wherto if we add now his Lordships false translation of <hi>suaca,</hi> and his addition of <hi>Illaica</hi> to the <hi>Arabique</hi> text (which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:15521:159"/> to alleadg entirely) I know not what more may be desired to shew the egregious fraud, and malice of them both; so as heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may be iudged, whether <hi>M. Collins</hi> had any reason to say afterwards as he doth <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>this is pregnant inough to iustify the Bishop from being such a falsary, as (I) would make him, &amp; that (I) may rather feare the imputation of it my selfe, as if the two letters F. T. were as many markes in my forhead to know a False Theefe thereby.</hi> Thus indeed he sayth, but how reasonably let the Reader iudge, seeing that insteed of iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Lord from the imputation of falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he himselfe hath increased the suspition &amp; fortifyed the imputation thereof by his diligent addition of the circumstances, which doe euidently discouer my Lords fraud. And whereas it is his pleasure to make vse of the letters F. T. to marke me in the forhead for a <hi>False Theefe,</hi> he might haue sayd it with some reason, if he could haue charged me truely to haue stolne so much as one word or syllable, now, or at any tyme, out of any sentence, which might make against me; whereas you see he hath pilfred, and stolne out of S. <hi>Ephraems</hi> text a whole sentence immediatly following the words which my Lord alleadged, and doe import much for the explication of S. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraems</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:15521:159"/> meaning; and therefore I remit it to the iudgment of the indifferent Reader, whether he or I, doe better deserue to be branded in the forhead with the marke of a <hi>False Theefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="59">59. Although this might suffice to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the intollerable fraud of my Lord, &amp; <hi>M. Collins;</hi> yet to make the same more cleare then the Sunne at noone day, it is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that there are in the sayd Diurnal (which M. <hi>Collins</hi> alleadged) certaine saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with prayers to the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to <hi>S. Michael,</hi> almost immediatly before the prayer of S. <hi>Ephraem,</hi> out of the which my Lord took his sentēce; &amp; in one of the sayd salutations to the B. Virgin (which is to be seen there <hi>fol</hi> 167.) there are these words towards the end therof <hi>pa.</hi> 173. <hi>Peace be to thee by whome we were deliuered from the fire of hell, O crowne of the faythfull that do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat or fight; peace be to thee, who art the holy shippe, and the port of saluation; peace be to thee to whome the Angell Gabriel was sent, who saluted thee saying reioyce O Virgin, the Lady of womē; reioyce o full of grace, our Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy wombe, because he that was borne of thee, is called Holy, &amp; the Son of God.</hi> PRAY TO HIM <hi>for the remission of our sinnes.</hi> Thus endeth that salutation, &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:15521:160"/> to the Blessed Virgin.</p>
            <p n="60">60. In like manner <hi>S.

Pray for vs, O Michael the Archangell, that our sinnes may be forgiuen vs for thy prayers, which are acceptable to our Lord.</hi> And after this there followeth a short prayer to Almighty God fol 205. which endeth thus: <hi>Heare our cry by the intercession of our Lady, and pure Virgin, and of S. Peter the Apostle, and of S. Nicholas, and of all Saints. Amen.</hi> And immediatly after this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth <hi>sol.</hi> 207. the prayer of <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p n="61">61. Now M. <hi>Collins,</hi> I would gladly heare what my Lord and you will say to al this; for if this Diurnall be S. <hi>Ephraems</hi> work or any part of the first tome of the true <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraem</hi> (which my Lord quoted expresly for the sentence which he alleadged) then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Lord did not vnderstand Saint <hi>Ephraem</hi> well, or els S. <hi>Ephrem</hi> contradicted that sentence in his practise, praying to others besydes Almighty God, as namely
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:15521:160"/> to our blessed Lady, and Saint <hi>Michaell.</hi> And if this be not Saint <hi>Ephraems</hi> worke, then it doth not iustify my Lords allegatiō of that sentence, out of the first tome of the true <hi>Ephrem;</hi> besides that it seemeth strange to me that my Lord could see that one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, consisting only of 5. or 6. words, &amp; could not see in the same <hi>Diurnal</hi> those long prayers to our Blessed Lady, and Saint <hi>Michaell</hi> a little before. Is not this to be willfully blynd? How well may the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Sauiour to the Pharisees <hi>Ioan.</hi> 9. be applyed to my Lord, and you: <hi>Si caeci essetis &amp;c. if you were blynde, you should haue no sinne, but now that you say we see, your sinne doth remayne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="62">62. Well then, to come now to the message which it hath pleased my Lord to send me, <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayth to me thus <hi>num.</hi> 22. <hi>pag.</hi> 241. <hi>As for Vossius</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slatour, and Prefacer, and setter forth, with whom you are so much delighted; as his name in Dutch (which was his naturall language) signifyes a Fox, so you are the Goose for your labour, if you credit him to farre: and this as I was wished from him that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands these things best, so I tel it you.</hi> Thus saith M. <hi>Collins,</hi> and I accept the message very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefully; and to the end I may returne the answere to my Lord with speed, by the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:15521:161"/> same messenger. I beseech you <hi>M. Collins</hi> as you brought me the message, so also to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer the answere, and to signify to his Lordship from me, these points, with all due respect to his person.</p>
            <p n="63">63. First, that his Lordship should haue done much better for his owne repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to haue sent his message by a wiser man: for as the prouerb saith. He that sends a foole on his errand, must goe after and do it himselfe.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Secondly that I rest as little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as before, concerning the first tome of the true <hi>Ephraem,</hi> which his Lordship alleadgeth: for albeyt you tell me of an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ephraem,</hi> distinguished by Tomes, yet you neyther tell me by whome it was set forth, nor where it was printed, nor where it is to be found; neyther doe you say that his Lordship tooke yt out of the first tome of that edition, but out of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript which was printed in Rome such a yeare, &amp; called a Diurnall, as indeed it may be well called, being but a little prayer book, conteyning diuers prayers for morning, euening, midnight, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall houres, with the 7. penitentiall psalmes, and amongst the rest there are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 5. or 6. prayers with the title of Saint
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:15521:161"/>
               <hi>Ephraem:</hi> so as that <hi>Diurnall</hi> cannot be called Saint <hi>Ephraems</hi> prayer, as Maister <hi>Collins</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, saying: <hi>That the Booke goeth vnder the name of</hi> Saint Ephraems <hi>Prayer;</hi> and much lesse is if the first come of the true <hi>Ephraem</hi> (as my Lord quoted it) and if it be Saint <hi>Ephraems</hi> worke, then the prayers there to our B. Lady, and Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> conuince my Lord of inexcusable fraud; and so you may tell his Lordship from me, and that he might haue seene those prayers, as well as that short sentence, if he had not beene wilfully blynd.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Thirdly that his Lordships addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Illaica</hi> to the Text, and his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>suaca,</hi> which he interpreteth <hi>praeter te,</hi> is also most fraudulent; which later indeed I suspected before, albeit I could not charg his Lordship directly with it, vntill now that you <hi>M. Collins</hi> haue directed where to fynde it, as I haue done by your good help, and therefore how much he is behoulding to you for this, I leaue it to his Lordships iudgment.</p>
            <p n="66">66. Fourthly you may also tell his Lordship for his better information, that if he do beleiue that the <hi>Maronits</hi> (out of whose <hi>Diurnall</hi> he pretendeth to haue taken the sentence) are Monks in a monastery
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:15521:162"/> on Mount <hi>Sinah</hi> (as you say they are) his Lordship is much deceiued; for the <hi>Maronits</hi> are a people dwelling on Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> many dayes iourney from mount <hi>Sinah;</hi> and albeit there are monks among them, as also on mount <hi>Sinah,</hi> yet they are of different or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and cōtryes; for the <hi>Maronits</hi> on mount <hi>Libanus</hi> are of S. <hi>Antonies</hi> order, and those of <hi>Sinah,</hi> being Greeks, are of S. <hi>Basills</hi> order, and are not called <hi>Maronitae,</hi> but <hi>Melchitae.</hi> Thus much by the way for my Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and yours.</p>
            <p n="67">67. Fiftly, that put the case his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships translation were true, and that S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> had said, <hi>Non precor quemquam praeter te,</hi> yet his applicatiō therof against prayer to Saints, is neither to the purpose, nor voyd of fraud; seeing that the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which his Lordship concealed, &amp; you <hi>M. Collins</hi> haue now layd down little to his honour) do manifestly shew, that the place doth nothing preiudice prayer to saints, for the causes signifyed so lately, that I need not to repeate them now: and therefore wheras you M. <hi>Collins,</hi> make such account of that sentence, that you haue prefixed it before the second part of your book (where you professe to treate purposely of prayer to Saints) setting it downe vnder the title
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:15521:162"/> thus. <hi>Ephraem. To thee, and but to thee, to none I make my prayer;</hi> you may do well to remoue it from thence, and set it amongst the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and faults escaped in the print, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put it vp in your pocket, that there may be no more memory of it, nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of my Lords forgery, and your fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="68">68. Sixtly, whereas my Lord doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect the edition of <hi>S. Ephraems</hi> workes, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated by <hi>Vossius,</hi> yea and (as you tell me also afterwards <hi>pag.</hi> 243. <hi>lin. vlt.</hi>) his Lordship will auouch it (howsoeuer the first tome of <hi>Vossius</hi> his edition may be of the true <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraem</hi>) yet the rest are no more <hi>Ephraems</hi> works then his owne; wheras I say you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this in my Lords name, you may tell his Lordship, if you please, that albeit I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg him to be a man of great digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as being Counsailour to the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty my soueraigne, &amp; therfore I do beare him all due respect) yet I cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his authority to be so great, that his bare word shall stand for a law, and suffice to censure, controle, &amp; condemne Authors as his pleasure, without yeilding any cause or reason why, especially in this case now in question touching <hi>Vossius,</hi> seeing that I haue giuen in my Adioynder (as you haue
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:15521:163"/> seene before) sufficient reasons to iustify his edition, which both my Lord, and you M. <hi>Collins</hi> haue seene in my Adioynder, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles you dissemble it wholy, and vrge my Lords bare auouchment, and affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the contrary, as though the same were sufficient to confute all that which I haue sayd, or can be sayd in defence of <hi>Vos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius.</hi> Therefore you may tell my Lord, that as yet I see no reason, why the place allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> out of S. <hi>Ephraems</hi> works to proue prayer to Saints, should not stand in full force, notwithstanding the exception which his Lordship taketh to the edition of <hi>Vossius;</hi> in which respect I will also be bould to make vse of S. <hi>Ephraems</hi> testimonyes heereafter, out of the same edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as occasion shall serue, vntill my Lord or you do disproue it, with some better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then my Lords bare word.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Lastly I would gladly haue my Lord to vnderstand (though I thinke you will be loath to tell him) that he had neuer worse lucke in his life, then when he made choyce of you for his Champion; for you are so farre from performing the office of a good Champion, that you rather play the part of a bad Tinker, who in labouring to stop one hole in a Kettle, commonly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15521:163"/> two or three more, &amp; leaueth it much worse then he found it; for truly so doe you heere deale with my Lord, making his cause much worse then it was; so as his Lordship should haue prouided better for his owne honour, to haue let you still be silent, as you were amongst the <hi>Canes muti non valentes latrare</hi> (of whome the Prophet <hi>Isay</hi> speaketh <hi>cap.</hi> 56.) then to set your ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue on talking so much to his owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, as heere he hath done; and therefore not only I, but also his Lorship hath great reason to shut vp your mouth heereafter with <hi>Obmutesce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="70">70. But now to proceed, I omit a world of fooleryes, and impertinent <hi>cauills</hi> in his answere to my <hi>Adionder</hi> touching cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine places of S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Maximus,</hi> &amp; will discouer his most fraudulēt answer concerning a place which Card. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alleadged in his Apology, of an Oration of Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> made in the feast of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> wherein he not only prayed to the Saint saying, <hi>Tu è superis nos respice, &amp; populum hunc sanctum dirige: Behould vs from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, and direct this holy people;</hi> but also recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the story of a holy Virgin called <hi>Iustina,</hi> who being extremly tempted by the diuel, and her chastity endangered (by the means
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:15521:164"/> of Necromancy) deuoutly implored the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary, whereby togeather with her other holy endeauours she ouercame the temptation. To this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the Cardinall, my Lord of <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> answereth three wayes; first that the Oration of <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> out of which this testimony is taken, is not <hi>liquida fidei,</hi> of cleare credit, because it is vncertain who that <hi>Cyprian</hi> was of whome he made that Oration, as namely whether he was <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bish. of <hi>Carthage</hi> (as he should seem to be by the circumstances mētioned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) or <hi>Cyprian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in which respect my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> sayth: <hi>Ita flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuat res tota, ita perplexa omnia,</hi> so vncertaine is the whole matter, and so perplexe, and doubtfull are all things in that Oration.</p>
            <p n="71">71. His second answere is, that it was but the fact of <hi>a Mayd,</hi> and then asketh whether <hi>the fact of a mayde be a statute of the Church? And whether a rule of fayth be to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon a Mayds act?</hi> And lastly he answereth that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> sharply reprehended the selfe same fact in the same Age in the <hi>Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Heretikes, when it was done by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the same sexe. To these three answ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> I replyed in my Adioynder thus. <hi>pag.</hi> 252. <hi>lin.</hi> 6. <q>You
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:15521:164"/> see how substantially he argueth, inferring that the matter, and substance of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is vncertayne, because it is doubtfull of which <hi>Cyprian</hi> the oration was made; wheras neuertheles he cannot with any reason deny but that the oratiō is <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzens:</hi> wherupon it must needs follow that albeit <hi>Nazianzen</hi> should be deceiued, and erre in the history, or the person of whome he speaketh, yet the substance as well of the story, as of the doctrine contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that Oration, was true in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, and therfore may serue for an assured testimony of his beliefe, and of the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the Church in his tyme (which is the only poynt now in question) and therfore seeing that he not only prayed to a Saynt himselfe, but also signifyed that a holy Virgin did the lyke; it is cleare, that both he himselfe, and also the faythfull people in those dayes, held it to be lawfull, and practised it as occasion requyred.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="72">72. <q>And whereas <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> addeth concerning the latter poynt (to wit, the prayer of the mayde) that it was <hi>but a fact of a mayd,</hi> and then asketh whether the <hi>fact of a mayd is a statute of the Church?</hi> and whether a rule of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ayth is to be grounded vpon a mayds act? I haue sufficiently answered
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:15521:165"/> him already touching the statutes, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Church concerning this point; and now tell him agayne, that there was neyther at that tyme, any need of statutes for prayer to Saynts, which then was euery where in practise; neyther is it now in question what the Church decreed then touching the same, but what was then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally practised and belieued, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better, and more clearely proued by any testimonyes of the Fathers, then by such as witnesse, not only their owne facts, but also the practise of other Christians, eyther in their dayes, or els in former ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, as this was which <hi>S. Gregory</hi> affirmeth of that holy mayd.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="73">73. <q>But will you now heare how well <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> concludeth al this matter? forsooth he maketh an obiection against himselfe, saying in a different letter (as if the obiection were the Cardinals) <hi>sed factum non reprehenditur,</hi> but this fact of the mayd is not reprehended by <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen:</hi> and then he addeth answering to his owne obiection: <hi>Immò idem illud &amp;c. yea, but Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius sharpely reprehended the selfe same, in the same age, in the Collyridian heretykes, when it was done by many of the same sexe.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> playing his part kindly, as well in his
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:15521:165"/> obiection as in his answere. For in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection (wherin he would seeme to speake for the Cardinall, or rather to lay downe his words) he dissembleth altogether what the Cardinall saith to vrge, and fortify that example of the mayde, and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth purposely, as it may be thought, to set it downe in his margent with the rest of the Cardinalls text; who after the words of <hi>S. Gregory</hi> before related (to wit <hi>Virginem Mariam rogauit &amp;c. She besought the Virgin Mary to succour a Virgin in danger</hi>) addeth immediatly, <hi>ac paulò post resert eam</hi> &amp;c. and a litle after <hi>(Nazianzen)</hi> declareth that her prayer was heard. <hi>Vicit, inquit, virgo, vincitur daemon.</hi> The Virgin (saith he) ouercame, and the Diuel is ouercome. Thus doth the Cardinall vrge this example, which as you see, is of much more force, then to say only (as <hi>M. Andrews</hi> saith) that <hi>S. Gregory</hi> did not reprehend the fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="74">74. <q>For albeit his silence in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending it, may serue for an argument that he did not mislyke it, yet the other clearely proueth that not only he, but also God himselfe did notably approue it, seing he saith that she obtayned the effect of her prayer, and ouercame the Diuell: whereto I also add, that when that holy Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:15521:166"/> to recount the history of the mayd, he sayth thus: <hi>Audite Virgines, ac simul exultate &amp;c. Harken o ye Virgins, and reioyce also, yea all ye that esteeme chastity in matrimony, and loue Virgins, giue eare, for to both sorts this my narration may serue for an ornament.</hi> So he. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth playnely that he meant to recount that which he would wish to be approued and imitated by others: whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that by this example he exhorted, and encouraged all those whose chastity should be endangered, to craue the help of the blessed Virgin, as that holy mayd did, who thereby (togeather with her other deuotious of fasting, &amp; prayer to almighty God, which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> relateth) ouercame the Diuell, and escaped the danger of his tentation. And could this holy Father more euidently declare what his faith and beliefe was, concerning prayer to Saints, then not only to relate this fact of a holy Virgin without reprehension of it, but also to signify the happy euent, and successe thereof, yea, and to incyte others to the approbation, and imitation of it?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="75">75. <q>But now sayth <hi>M. Andrewes,</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lthough <hi>Nazianzen</hi> did not reprehend it: yet <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> did sharply reproue <hi>idem illud,</hi> euen the selfe same fact in the same age in other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15521:166"/> If this be true, <hi>M. Andrews</hi> doth indeed say somewhat to the purpose (at least to proue that the Fathers of that age did not with vnanime consent allow prayers to Saynts;) but if it be false, and that he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belyeth S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> what shall we think of the mans conscience, and cause? The truth is, <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> sharply reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth certayne womē who vsed at a certain time of the yeare to commit Idolatry to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> adoring her with diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, offring to her certain cakes in sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as though she had byn a God, or a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse, and they her Priests: whereupon he discourseth amply, prouing first out of the old Testament, that <hi>nusquam mulier sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficauit, aut Sacerdotio suncta est,</hi> women haue neuer sacrifyced any where, or executed Priestly function. And then he commeth to the new Testament, where he sheweth also the same, and addeth further, that if women could euer haue byn admitted to Sacrifyce, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her selfe should haue done it rather, then any other, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles she neuer did: and finally he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that the body of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was <hi>reuerà sanctum, sed non Deus,</hi> truely holy, but not God,</q>
            </p>
            <p n="76">76. <q>By all which it appeareth, that
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:15521:167"/> these women, which <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, did not only take vpon them the Priestly function, but also committed flat Idolatry, adoring the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with diuine honour, offring sacrifice vnto her, which is a worship due to God alon. Now then could a man belieue that <hi>M. Andrewes,</hi> or any man els that hath care of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would be so shamelesse to say, that this is <hi>idem illud,</hi> that very selfe same thing which, <hi>Nazianzen</hi> sayth, that holy Virgin did, who only craued help of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> Is there no differēce betwixt praying, &amp; sacrifysing? betwixt Idolatry, &amp; religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous veneration due to Gods Saints, &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants? Or betwixt the vsurpatiō of Priestly functiō (whereof no woman is capable) &amp; the oblation of priuate prayers, which is as free for women, as men? Doth euery one, or any one that prayeth to Saynts or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, crauing their help, and assistance (as that holy Virgin did) doth he, I say, adore them as Gods, commit idolatry, offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, vsurpe the function of a Priest as those women did, whom <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reprehended? Truly if <hi>M. Andrews</hi> can iustify this, he may boldly say, and write what he list. So as now you see, that whereas he vndertooke to proue that this testimony of <hi>S. Gregory
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:15521:167"/> Nazianzen</hi> is not <hi>liquidae fidei,</hi> of cleare credit, he hath obscured, or rather clearely lost his owne credit, by an euident, and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abuse of <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> without giuing the least blemish, or taint in the world to the credit of the place that he impugneth: by the which it appeareth euidently, that the <hi>Inuocation of Saints</hi> was vsuall in the time of <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> seeing that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did both <hi>inuocate Saints,</hi> and also testify and approue the practise of it in others, as you haue heard: and this shal suffice for him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="77">77. Thus sayd I in my <hi>Adioynder,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you see, I not only confuted my Lord of <hi>VVinchesters</hi> answere to the Cardinalls obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but also charged his Lordship with two frauds, the one in dissembling, and cōcealing wholy that which most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the obiection, I meane the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances which the Cardinall vrged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Mayds example in praying to the Blessed Virgin, to wit, the good successe, and effect of her prayers, and other holy endeauours which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> signifyed, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Vicit virgo, &amp; vincitur Daemon: The Mayd ouercame, and the Diuell was ouercome;</hi> and the other fraud was, an intollerable abuse of <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> in affirming, that he condemned
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:15521:168"/> in the <hi>Collyridian</hi> Heretiks <hi>idem illud,</hi> the selfe same act of the Mayd, who prayed only to the immaculate Mother of God (not as to a God, or Goddesse, but as to a creature most acceptable to God;) whereas that which S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> condemned in the <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> Heretiks, was flat Idolatry, which they committed, offring sacrifice to the B. Virgin, which is due to God alone.</p>
            <p n="78">78. Now then I doubt not, but that the Reader expecteth that <hi>M. Collins</hi> should say somewhat, if not to all my reply vpon My Lords answere, yet at the least to the imputation of the fraudes, wherwith I charged his Lordship, seeing he hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to defend him, and to cleare him of the fraudes, falsityes, and lyes, wherewith he sayth in his title, I slaundered his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. But heere, he not only dissembleth that which is most important in my reply, but also is wholy silent to the charge of the two fraudes, dissembling that which he could not answere.</p>
            <p n="79">79. And albeit in the ninth Chapter <hi>pag.</hi> 388. <hi>num.</hi> 24. he doth enlarge himselfe very much vpon that place of S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> spending no lesse the fiue or six pages, in a large Comment vpon it; neuertheles he maketh no mention at all of any imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:15521:168"/> of fraud, or abuse of <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I charged his Lordship) &amp; yet I gaue him sufficient occasion to do it euen in that place, where I recapitulated all my Lords frauds, falsityes, and lyes, &amp; among the rest, charged his Lordship with this in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer, saying, <hi>that he had egregiously abused, and flatly belyed</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>touching prayer to our Blessed Lady,</hi> which <hi>M. Collins</hi> thought best, to dissemble wholy, and yet to make some fayre florish vpon the place it selfe, because it treated of Idolatry, and seemed to him very fit, to gull some simple Reader, with the help of some false glosse, or comment of his; and this he thought he might doe without any hazard to my Lords honour, who being not so much as named or any wayes mentioned by him, should scape Scotfree for his fraude, albeit the Reader should not be satisfyed with the exposition of the place.</p>
            <p n="80">80. But you will say perhaps, that albeit <hi>M. Collins</hi> doth not name my Lord, nor mention my obiection of fraud to his Lordship, yet it may be hath cleared him sufficiently of the imputation, if he haue proued, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> condemned prayer to the Blessed Virgin, no lesse then sacrifice. But how hath he proued it? Forsooth, he
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:15521:169"/> sayth thus <hi>pag.</hi> 388. <hi>num.</hi> 24. <q>
                  <hi>Epiphanius</hi> yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> say, <hi>neuer reprehended praying to the Virgin Mary, but sacrifice only in the Colliridian gossipps. And was their sacrifice without prayer? Or could it well be?</hi> Remember I pray you, your owne princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; then shew where <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reprouing sacrifice, excepts praying, and condemnes not all their foppery in grosse: yet he scans the point nicely, and shews what we may giue to the Virgin without offence, what we may not, in all which, of prayer not a word he vouchsafes her.</q> Thus indeed sayth M. <hi>Collins,</hi> euen as much to the purpose, as if he had sayd iust nothing.</p>
            <p n="81">81. For what need I deny either that the prayer of these Idolaters cōcurred with their sacrifice, or that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> condemned them both? Seeing that (as wel their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as their sacrifice) was idolatrous, being offred to a creature, as to God. As also the like may be said euen of any act of worship or reuerence done to any man, or other creature as to God, either with prayer, or without it, in which respect the Christiās in the tyme of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, would not do any reuerence to his Image when it was painted with the Image of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they would not seeme to do an act of Idolatry to <hi>Iupiter;</hi> wheras they vsed to do
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:15521:169"/> reuerence to the Image of the Emperour, whē it was alone, as it is testifyed by S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen orat.</hi> 1. <hi>in Iulian.</hi> And no doubt the <hi>Collyridian</hi> gossips did acts of worship, &amp; veneratiō togeather with their sacrifice, &amp; prayer to the Blessed Virgin; which acts, were in like manner condemned by S. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius in grosse withall their soppery</hi> (as <hi>M. Collins</hi> saith very well) and yet I hope, he will not say, therefore that all acts of worships or reuerence done to creatures are vnlawfull: wherby you may see how wisely he argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and how like a Doctor of Diuinity, to reiect all prayer to Saints, because Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous prayer is to be reiected, not prouing prayer to Saints to be idolatrous, which neither he, nor his fellow Ministers shall euer be able to proue.</p>
            <p n="82">82. For as sacrifice may be lawfull, and vnlawful, so also we may say of prayer. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice offered to God is most lawfull, but offered to a creature is most vnlawfull, yea abominable; so also prayer made to almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God as God, or to a Saint as a Saint, (that is to a creature acceptable to God) is lawfull, and behouefull; but made to a Saint, or to any other creature as to God, is idolatrous and execrable: so as my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> ought to haue made a great
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:15521:170"/> difference betwixt the prayer of <hi>Iustina</hi> the holy Mayd in <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and that other of the <hi>Collyridian</hi> Gossips in <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> for the former was made to the Blessed Virgin, not as to God, but as to a creature (yet the Mother of God) and so was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and good, whereas the other prayer was made to her, not as to a creature, but as to God, and consequently was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and detestable; and therefore my Lord (if I may be bould to say it) ouerlashed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much, and greatly abused <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> when he said that, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reprehended the prayer of <hi>Iustina</hi> in the <hi>Collyridian</hi> Gossips and <hi>M. Collins</hi> did very wisely to passe it with silence, and become dumbe, when he could not tell how to defend, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it.</p>
            <p n="83">83. And this might suffice for this point, were it not that his glosse vpon S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is not only most false, and absurd, but also most iniurious to the blessed, and immaculate Mother of God; in which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I cannot omitte to discouer as well his impiety as his absurdity therin: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is so ample in it, that it cannot be confuted in a few wordes, I will make it the subiect of the next Chapter.</p>

And to this purpose he sayth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that <hi>God the VVord tooke flesh of the Virgin, yet not to the end that she should be adored, nor to make her a God nor that we should offer sacrifice in her name; nor that she should find wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And therfore S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> proueth also very amply, as I haue signifyed before in the last Chapter <hi>num.</hi> 74. that it was neuer heard, or read of in the ould or new Testament, that there were women-priests, which might offer
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:15521:172"/> sacrifice. Finally in the same sense, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he same purpose, he saith all the rest tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Adoration,</hi> which M. <hi>Collins</hi> alleadgeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="4">4. All this saith Saint <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and <hi>M. Collins</hi> alleadgeth it, with certaine other sentences, which shall also be considered after a whyle: but by all this which I haue cyted, it is euident, that those <hi>Collyridian</hi> gossips, holding the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> for a God, committed flat Idolatry, offering sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice vnto her, as her Priests; and that therefore Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> worthily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth all such adoration to be exhibited to her, or to any other creature; teaching neuerthelesse, that she is to be honoured as the mother of God, though not to be adored as God: whereby it appeareth that <hi>M. Collins,</hi> hath belyed Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, whom he affirmeth not to adiudge to her any <hi>adoration</hi> at all <hi>of what kynde soeuer;</hi> for if she be to be honoured, she is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:15521:173"/> some kynde of <hi>adoration,</hi> seeing that the word <hi>adoration</hi> signifieth not only diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne honour, and worship (in which sense Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> taketh it here) but also reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and ciuill worship, as I haue proued so amply, and clearely in my <hi>Adioynder,</hi> out of the holy scriptures, and fathers, that M. <hi>Collins</hi> himself graunteth both the different vse, and acception of the words, and also the different kynd of worship, or honour signified thereby; for he graunteth the <hi>ciuill adoration,</hi> though absurdly he denyeth the <hi>religious,</hi> calling that <hi>ciuill</hi> which is testified in the scripture to haue beene done to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and holy men, as I shall haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to shew amply, and to discouer his folly withall, in the tenth Chapter. But that which I wish to be noted for the present, is, his detestable impiety, seeing that in excluding the most blessed mother of God from all <hi>adoration of what kind soeuer,</hi> he doth not only exclude her from the religious worship, &amp; <hi>adoratiō</hi> which the church doth yeild her, but also from the <hi>ciuill adoration,</hi> which he himself graunteth may be giuen to mortall, and sinfull men: so as yf shee should appeare to any (as she hath done to many) she might not be adored so much as ciuilly, with cap, and knee, or bowing of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:15521:173"/> the body, which is a kind of ciuil adoratiō, that may be vsed to any man of quality.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But will you heare how Saint <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> himselfe checketh this fellow, <hi>hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> 78. writing against such others as he, I meane certaine hereticks called <hi>Antidicoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianitae,</hi> that is, sayth he, <hi>Aduersarij Mariae velut inimicitiam aduersus Virginem habentes, &amp; gloriam illius extenuare volentes</hi> &amp;c. The Aduersaryes of <hi>Mary,</hi> bearing, as it were, emnity agaynst the Virgin, and desyring to extenuate her glory &amp;c. to whome he sayth thus: <hi>VVho is he that out of the aboundance of an affected mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, would frame some blasphemous opinions, open his mouth, and loose his tongue out of a wicked mynd?</hi> Immò pro hymnis &amp; gloria, <hi>yea insteed of Hymnes, and glory, inuent, and vtter drunken, and contumelious speaches against the holy Virgin?</hi> Et vas honoratum non colere, <hi>and not to honour</hi> (or worship) <hi>that honorable Vessell</hi> &amp;c. Thus sayth Saint <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> For the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding whereof, yt is to be considered, that he wryteth this against certaine He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, who did teach that the Blessed Virgin, was not allwayes a Virgin, but that she had children by <hi>S. Ioseph</hi> after the byrth of <hi>Christ:</hi> to which purpose I wish 3. things to be noted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The first, that if <hi>M. Collins</hi> be not of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:15521:174"/> same opinion, he is not far from it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the principles of his maister <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> &amp; other sectaryes, who teach that the B. Virgin made no vow of chastity, or it she did, that she was not bound to obserue it: so as according to their doctrine she might haue done (if not better, yet) at least as wel to haue had the company of her husband, (being marryed) as to cōserue her virginity, which they hold to be of no greater merit then mariage; wherupon it followeth that if <hi>M. Collins</hi> agree in opinion with his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <hi>Caluin, Beza,</hi> &amp; other Sectaries (his bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thrē in the Lord) he hath no small affinity, &amp; participation with the <hi>Antidicomarianita,</hi> whom Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> confuteth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth for enemyes to the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and most blasphemous heretiks.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The second thing which I wish to be noted is, that albeit S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> make no particuler mention of any other disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that those hereticks did her, eyther in word, or deed; yet it may be gathered by this, which I haue here alleadged out of him, that they refused to do her publick honour, and seruice, <hi>with hymnes, and glory,</hi> as the Church vseth, which you see, he blameth and vtterly condemneth, not only in them, but also consequently in <hi>M. Collins,</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:15521:174"/> and all his fellows, who do in that poynt fully participate with them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The third is, that it is euident by this place of <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> that he is so farre from denying to the Blessed Virgin all <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what kind soeuer,</hi> that he expresly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth those which do not honour, and glorify her with <hi>Hymnes and Prayses,</hi> which is part of the worship, and <hi>adoration</hi> that the Church doth exhibite vnto her, and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed her by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> who therefore is heere ouertaken euery way, &amp; proued not only to be one of those blasphemous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks (or at least cozen-german to them) but also to haue shamefully belyed S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in making him deny to the Blessed Virgin <hi>all adoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Lastly, it is cleare by all the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> denyeth no other <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or worship of the Blessed Virgin, then all Catholikes do, that is to say <hi>diuine adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in which respect he condemneth, and worthily derideth the Idolatry of those fantasticall womē who made her a God, &amp; did sacrifice to her as her priests, which we should no lesse detest, and deride, then he, if any vsed the like at this tyme.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But perhaps he will say, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we do not worship her with diuin
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:15521:175"/>
               <hi>adoration,</hi> yet we giue her more then is doe vnto her in the opinion of <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> who alloweth lesse honor vnto her, thē to holy men, and farre lesse then to Angells. This indeed M. <hi>Collins</hi> laboureth to proue out of <hi>S. Epiphanius;</hi> and as he is very ready to take hold of euery thing that may seeme any way to diminish the honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Blessed Virgin, he first obserueth, that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> wisheth it to be noted in the holy Scripture, that our Sauiour called her <hi>VVoman Ioan.</hi> 2. at the Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> saying to her (whē she tould him that there wanted wine) <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi est mulier? Nondum venit hora mea VVhat haue I to do with thee woman? My houre is not yet come: to the end that some might not thinke that the holy Virgin was more excellent, as it were foreshewing what should happen in the world by sects, and heresies, that some through too great admiration of that holy woman, might not slyde into heresy, and the dotage thereof; for in very truth all this passage is nothing els, but a meere mockery, and an old womans tale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Thus sayth <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> cyted by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> wherein there is nothing that may iustly be taken, as sayd in disgrace of the Blessed Virgin, if we consider that <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> writing against those giddy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded women, who made her God, had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:15521:175"/> to vrge what he could, concerning the infirmity of her nature, &amp; sexe, to correct their exorbitant conceipt of her diuinity; as he that would make streight a crooked sticke, doth bend it backe the other way, as farre as he may without breaking it: &amp; therefore when he wrote immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore against those which were her enemyes (to wit the <hi>Antidicomarianitae</hi> (M. <hi>Collins</hi> his Cozen-germans) he vrged her eminent dignity in being the mother of God, and called her <hi>Matrem viuentium,</hi> the Mother of the liuing, <hi>&amp; causam vitae,</hi> and the cause of life to all true Christians, detesting the blasphemy and drunken madnes of those which sought to extenuate her glory, as I haue partly signifyed before, and shall haue occasion to declare further heereafter.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Therefore whereas our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are wont to make great vse of those wordes of our Sauiour to his Blessed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to proue the little esteeme he made of her, in calling her <hi>woman,</hi> and saying vnto her: <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi est mulier?</hi> We may well say, that if the whole passage and story be wel considered, it maketh exceeding much for her prayse, and proueth cleerely the force of her prayers, &amp; intercession for vs; seeing it appeareth thereby, that the only
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:15521:176"/> insinuation of her desire to haue the want of wyne supplyed (though it were by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle) was so powerfull with our Sauiour, that he was content to satisfy her desire, the tyme being not yet come, for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that miracle, which he signifyed, saying, <hi>nondum venit hora mea,</hi> my tyme is not yet come, and therfore I say it may wel be thoght, that to the end it might appeare how much he esteemed and honoured her, and of what force her intercession should alwayes be with him, he ordayned to doe his first miracle, as it were out of tyme, and at her suite and request, or rather vpon the very insinuation of her desire, for she sayd only to him, <hi>Vinum non habent,</hi> they haue no wine. This may be confirmed out <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose serm.</hi> 16. <hi>in psal.</hi> 118. <hi>S. Cyril. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. and <hi>S. Chrysostome hom.</hi> 21. who affirme that our Sauiour did that miracle sooner then otherwayes he would haue done, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of his Mother,</p>
            <p n="13">13. But then you will aske me, why did he reprehend her saying: <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi est Mulier &amp;c.</hi> what haue I to do with thee woman? Wherto I answere, that it may well be gathered by that which followeth that it was no reprehension, but an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to her; and therefore S. <hi>Iustinus</hi> sayth
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:15521:176"/>
               <hi>quaest.</hi> 126 <hi>Non verbo matrem obiurgauit, cùm e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am sacto honorauit,</hi> Christ did not chide, or reprehend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mother, when he honoured her with the fact. Also S. <hi>Cyril</hi> sayth <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. <hi>Quantus honor parentibus &amp;c.</hi> Christ shewed how great honour is due to parēts, seeing that he presently did the act (that is to say, he wrought the miracle) <hi>propter Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem</hi> for his Mother; besides that it may wel be thought that if he had reprehended her for it, she would not haue persisted in her desire, and much lesse would she haue insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted vpon the performance of it, as she did saying presently to the seruants: <hi>Quodcum{que} vobis dixerit sacite,</hi> do whatsoeuer he shall say vnto you; whereby it appeareth that she and our Sauiour vnderstood one another well inough, and that he was so farre from reprehending her, that he graunted her request, and that she knew it (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that answere,) and also knew that he meant to giue order to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes to doe somewhat for the execution of it, and therupon she sayd to them, <hi>Doe whatsoeuer he shall command you,</hi> as <hi>S. Cyril</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth expresly <hi>vbi supra cap.</hi> 24. saying thus: <hi>The Mother of Christ was not ignorant, that he did deserre, or attribute great authority and dignity vnto her, who hauing perswaded (or induced him to do the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:15521:177"/> miracle) in such manner as was conuenient, did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and exhort the seruants to do all that which he should command them.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Therefore albeit there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions, and interpretations of those wordes <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi est mulier?</hi> Yet that which is most common &amp; most probable, is, that for as much as she demanded of him a miracle, which surpassed the power of nature, and was to be done by him as he was God, he vsed those wordes, shevving lesse respect vnto her, then othervvayes might seeme conuenient from a Sonne to his Mother; to leaue vs this document, that in things pertaining to Almighty God and to his seruice, no respect is to be had to flesh and bloud; and therfore <hi>S. Bernard</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth very well <hi>serm.</hi> 2. <hi>Dom.</hi> 1. <hi>post octan. Epiphan.</hi> that Christ vsed that manner of speach, <hi>non propter Matrem, sed propter nos,</hi> not for his Mother, but for vs, that is to say, for our instruction; for which cause also he seemed to make small accompt of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and kinsfolkes, when some interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his preaching, and tould him that his Mother and brethren sought for him <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>Quae,</hi> sayth he, <hi>est mater mea &amp;c.</hi> who is my Mother, and who are my Brethren? And then holding out his hands towardes
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:15521:177"/> his disciples, he sayd: <hi>Behould my Mother, and behould my brethren &amp;c.</hi> In like manner he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to speake to his Mother, and to S. <hi>Ioseph</hi> with small respect <hi>Luc.</hi> 2. when they found him in the Temple, &amp; tould him that they had sought him with sorrow: <hi>Quid est,</hi> sayth he, <hi>quod me quaercbatis &amp;c.</hi> Why did you seeke me? Did you not know, that I must imploy my selfe in those things which belonge to my Father? And yet the Euangelist testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the same place presently after, that he went with them to <hi>Nazareth, &amp; erat sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus illis,</hi> and was subiect to them, that is to say, in all domesticall dutyes, and such things as belonged to his humanity. And this interpretation of those words, <hi>quid mihi &amp; tibi est mulier?</hi> (to wit that he spake to her as he was God, and not as he was man) is conforme to the opinion of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this place <hi>tract.</hi> 119. <hi>lib. de fide, &amp; simbolo cap.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de fide ad Catechum. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>S.

            <p n="15">15. And as for the obseruation of <hi>S. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi> that our Sauiour called her <hi>woman,</hi> I say, that albeit there want not good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, who do expound it rather to her
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:15521:178"/> commendation then otherwayes (as that he called her woman <hi>per excellentiam,</hi> for the excellency of her person, as being the chiefe <hi>woman,</hi> in which respect, she is also called only <hi>Mary,</hi> many tymes, as the chiefe <hi>Mary;</hi> which I obserue heere the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>M. Collins</hi> noteth in his margent out of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> that he calleth her only <hi>Mary, Mary</hi>) neuertheles I do not deny but that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> might among other reasons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conceiue that our Sauiour foreseeing that heresy of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> (who esteemed &amp; serued her as God) called her a <hi>woman,</hi> to arme vs against that heresy, and dotage of theirs; but this no way concerneth vs who do know, and acknowledge her to be a woman, and a meere creature of God, as all others both men, and women, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells are; and therefore <hi>M. Collins</hi> sheweth more malice, then wit, to apply this to vs. Besides that, I cannot omit to note by the way, a pretty sleight of his, not voyde of fraud, in his allegation and translation of this place of <hi>S. Epiphanius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. For wheras that Father alleadging those words of the holy Scripture, <hi>Quid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi &amp; tibi est mulier?</hi> addeth therto <hi>curae,</hi> and hath them thus: <hi>Quid mihi &amp; tibi est curae mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier?</hi> that is to say, <hi>VVoman what haue I, and thou
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:15521:178"/> to do with it? M. Collins</hi> setting downe the text of S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> at large, leaueth out <hi>curae</hi> both in the Latin, and in the English, and translateth the Latin thus, <hi>what haue I to do with thee woman?</hi> Which wordes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, as <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> readeth, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth them, not only in this place (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by <hi>M. Collins</hi>) but also <hi>haeres.</hi> 51.00 not containe any asperity and sharpnes at all, and therefore <hi>M. Collins</hi> thought it better to falsify <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> though he himselfe alleadgeth him, then by alleadging him truely to giue some inkling of a more mild exposition and sense thereof; albeit the same is not the interpretation of <hi>S. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> only, but also of <hi>Iustinus quaest.</hi> 136. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius</hi> in his Commētary vpon this Ghos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and of diuers others both ancient and moderne; but howsoeuer those words are to be vnderstood, they doe nothing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice our cause who do not deny our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Lady to be a woman, and much lesse do make her a God: besids that, the whole cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of that story which <hi>S. Epipha.</hi> only tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, doth notably proue the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and force of the B. Virgins prayers, &amp; intercession to her Sonne, (as I haue signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed before) and therefore may very well incite, and moue vs to haue recourse vnto
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:15521:179"/> her, that she may recommend vs, and our necessityes vnto him.</p>
            <p n="17">17. And now to proceed with <hi>M. Collins</hi> his comment; after he cyteth these wordes out of S. <hi>Epiphanius: Quae verò Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura de hoc narrauit? Quis Prophetarum praecepit hominem adorari, nedum mulierem?</hi> that is. <hi>VVhat Scripture informeth vs heereof? VVhich of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets commanded any man to be worshiped, much lesse a VVoman? See you how he reduceth this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy to Scripture? Yet the Adioynder makes no reckoning of Scripture in this question, so we haue miracles, and traditions, and other obseruations. VVell it was lawfull for</hi> Epiphanius <hi>to fly to that,</hi> Quae verò Scriptura, <hi>and</hi> Quis Propheta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum praecepit &amp;c. <hi>See you also how he prefers not a few before the Virgin? For we must not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship man,</hi> sayth he, <hi>much lesse a VVoman, belike though it be the Virgin her selfe:</hi> Eximium qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem est vas, sed Mulier, &amp; nihil à natura immutata, <hi>that is, An excellent Vessell she is no doubt, but yet a woman, and not a whit changed in regard of her nature.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins</hi> with more which shallbe examined anon.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Now whereas he noteth very seriously in S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he reduceth this controuersy to Scripture, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles the <hi>Adioynder</hi> makes no reckoning of scripture in this question, truly he is very
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:15521:179"/> seriously idle in saying so, and the rather because he chargeth the Adioynder, with contempt of Scripture, without telling vs where he fyndeth it, or what the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder sayth to that purpose; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I omitt to answere it, as one of his fooleryes, not worth the answering, and wish to be obserued in the rest what a friend he is to the blessed Virgin, whome he depriueth of all honour, and worship, yea more then any man, by reason of the naturall infirmity of her sexe, as being stil a woman, and not a whit changed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her nature; which reason as it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> might make it cleare i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>M. Collins</hi> (if he were not willfully and malitiously blind) that the worship wherof he treateth, &amp; which he denyeth more to women, then to men, is onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship; for so the argument of Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is very good, whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways it were absurd, and he should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himself; to which purpose it is to be considered, that diuine adoration, or worship can be due to none, who hath not true diuinity; and for as much as diuinity must needs be naturall (for God is God by nature, and not by grace) it followeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, that if a man, who is by nature
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:15521:180"/> more perfect then a woman, cannot haue true diuinity (nor consequently diuyne worship (much lesse can a woman haue it, and therefore the blessed Virgin being still a woman (though glorifyed) is much lesse capable of diuinity, and consequently of diuine honour then a man; and thus I say the Argument of S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is good.</p>
            <p n="19">19. But if we vnderstand worship (not as it is diuine, but as it may be due to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (participating of the diuine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) the argument of S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> will be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, &amp; so wil become to be the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of M. <hi>Collins</hi> as indeed it is, and not of <hi>S. Epiphanius:</hi> &amp; this I say, because a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though she be inferiour to a man by nature, yet by grace may farre excell him, and consequently deserue a farre greater worship then he; so as that learned Father was neuer so simple, to make such an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as M. <hi>Collins</hi> would haue him to do, as first to exclude all men from all kind of worship (which were ridiculous) and thē to inferre also thereupon, that no woman ought to be worshipped. For albeit Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God had not, or would not bestow so much grace vpon any man, as to make him worthy of worship, yet he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow it vpon some woman, or vpon all
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:15521:180"/> women if it pleased him, and consequently make them more worthy of worship, then any man, which is indeed veryfied in the B. Virgin, who albeit by nature she be inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to any man, yet by grace she excelleth all men, yea and all Angells, as shalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared after a whyle: whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that she deserueth more worship then they all.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Moreouer I haue made it manifest allready (and therefore need not to repeat it) that S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> teacheth expresly that the most B. Virgin, is to be honoured, or worshipped with <hi>hymnes and glory,</hi> and that he inueigheth bitterly against those, who refuse to do it, so as he should contradict himselfe most ridiculously if he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude her from all worship; eyther in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the infirmity of her sexe, or for any other cause whatsoeuer, albeyt he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to debarre her from diuine honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause neyther she, nor humane nature is any way capable therof.</p>
            <p n="21">21. <q>But let vs follow <hi>M. Collins</hi> a little further, thus then he proceedeth.

            <p n="22">22. First, that S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth euen in these words alleadged heer by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> not only distinguish betwixt diuyne ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the honour due to the blessed Virgin; but also teach expresly, that she, &amp; the Saints, yea &amp; their very reliks are to be honoured, which also is more euident and effectuall in the text of S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thē as <hi>M. Collins</hi> abridgeth, and glosseth it. For S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> hauing asked the question, <hi>Quis prophetarum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>VVhich of the prophets did euer commaund that any man should be adored much lesse a woman?</hi> addeth presently touching the blessed Virgin thus: <hi>Eximium est</hi> &amp;c. <hi>truly the is a notable Vessel, yet a woman, and nothing changed in regard of her nature: Verum &amp; intellect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> &amp; sensu in honore honorata, sicut corpora sanctorum</hi>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:15521:181"/> &amp;c. <hi>but honoured both in vnderstanding and sense</hi> (that is to say both with internall, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall honour) <hi>as the bodyes of Saints.</hi> Thus sayth S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> with the rest that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth set downe by <hi>M. Collins</hi> concerning <hi>Elias, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Tecla;</hi> wherin it is manifest that he denyeth to the blessed Virgin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship only, and acknowledgeth that there is due vnto her an inferiour ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both mentall, and corporall, such as may be done to creatures, namely to the bodyes, or relikes of Saints, to <hi>Elias,</hi> to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to <hi>Tecla;</hi> affirming neuertheles that the blessed Virgin is more to be honoured then <hi>Tecla,</hi> because she was the mother of God; by which reason she is also more honorable then eyther <hi>Elias,</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> or any other holy man or woman, seeing she had that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler priuiledge aboue all other creaturs.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Therefore for as much as honour is to be exhibited to any one more or lesse; according to the greater, or lesser tytles, &amp; considerations that moue thereto, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that the blessed Virgin hauing the greatest title of honour that euer creature had, (to wit to be the mother of God) is more to be honoured then any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, euen according to the argument of S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> yet so, as not to arryue to diuine
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:15521:182"/> honour, and therfore he sayth, <hi>sed ne{que} Ec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

Epiphanius</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himself in denying to <hi>Elias, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Tecla,</hi> the honour that heere he alloweth them, acknowledging that the blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is to be honoured like to them; besy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> who was most conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the holy scripture (as appeareth in his workes) should haue forgot himselfe very much in denying to <hi>Elias</hi> all odoratiō, seeing the scripture doth testify 3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 18. that <hi>Abdias</hi> (who although he was steward to the wicked King <hi>Achab,</hi> yet was himselfe a man that feared God) did an act of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to <hi>Elias,</hi> falling vpon his face before him, which the prophet would not haue permitted if it had not beene lawful; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I may add the example of the adoratiō done by the children of the Prophets to <hi>Elizaeus</hi> when they saw, by his miraculous passage of the Riuer, that God had giuen him the spirit of <hi>Elias, adorauerunt eum,</hi> sayth the Scripture, <hi>proni in terram,</hi> they adored him falling flat vpon the ground 4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2.
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:15521:182"/> and therefore when S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> asketh <hi>quis prophetarum &amp;c. VVhich of the Prophets, did euer command that a man should be adored,</hi> he meant not thereby to deny to men all adoration, but only diuine worship, for otherwayes <hi>Abdias</hi> should haue erred greatly in adoring <hi>Elias;</hi> and the children of the Prophets in adoring <hi>Elizaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. But will you see how well M. <hi>Collins</hi> gloseth those wordes. <hi>Sed ne{que} Elias a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorandus est etiamsi in viuis sit,</hi> but neither <hi>Elias</hi> is to be adored, though he be liuing? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he sayth, <hi>Not only no dead Saint, but not so much as they that neuer dyed may be adored.</hi> So he. Ful wisely contradicting the text with his glosse, except he take <hi>adored</hi> there to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify diuine honour; for you see <hi>S. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> sayth expresly that the Blessed Virgin is to be honoured, as the bodyes of Saints, (that is to say, the dead bodyes of Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased) and albeit he say that <hi>Elias</hi> is still li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, yet he acknowledgeth both <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp; <hi>Tecla</hi> to be dead, and yet to be honoured, for otherwayes he could not say that the B. Virgin is to be honoured like to them, if they were not to be honoured at al; thogh it be true that neither they, nor <hi>Elias,</hi> nor the Blessed Virgin, are to be adored, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>adored</hi> to signify diuine honour, as
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:15521:183"/> indeed <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> vseth it there, and throughout all his discourse.</p>
            <p n="25">25. And as well to the purpose is also another glosse of his shortly after vpon the same words, saying: <q>VVas it not possible, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> should light vpon your distinction of diminitiue adoration, that so often, so peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes it to the Saints, that it is lawfull to adore them, and neuer expounds himselfe?</q> So he. To which wise question of his, I answere, that it was nor only possible, that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> should light vpon our distinction, but also that he did light vpon it indeed, and sufficiently expound himselfe; for when he sayth, as you haue heard, <hi>let Mary be honoured, and God adored;</hi> and that <hi>Mary is holy and honoured, but not to be adored;</hi> &amp; againe that she is <hi>honoured both by vnderstanding and sense</hi> (that is to say, both with internall, and externall honour) and yet not to be adored, he light vpon our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>diminitiue adoration</hi> (as it pleaseth <hi>M. Collins</hi> to tearme it) or rather to giue it the right terme, our distinction of <hi>dulia,</hi> and <hi>latria;</hi> for by the adoration which he denyeth to the Blessed Virgin he signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>latriam,</hi> that is to say, diuine honour, and by the honour which he granteth her he signifyeth <hi>duliam,</hi> that is to say, an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour honour due to creatures, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:15521:183"/> of God; yea and when he sayth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that she is more honourable then <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cla,</hi> because she was the Mother of God, (wherein she excelleth all creatures) he sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth <hi>hyperduliam,</hi> that is to say, superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue honour aboue all other, which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is indeed due, and proper to her in respect of her supereminent dignity, and excellency by being the Mother of God.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Therfore when <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> sayth that she is to be honoured, as the bodyes of Saints, as <hi>Elias,</hi> as <hi>Iohn,</hi> as <hi>Tecla,</hi> his meaning is not that she cannot receaue a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honour then they, but that she is to be honoured with the same kind of honour that they are, that is to say with an honour due to creatures, &amp; not with that which is due to the Creatour, she being a creature as well as they, and no more capable of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or of diuine honour then they.</p>
            <p n="27">27. For if we do not vnderstand <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> so, we must say also that his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was, that <hi>the bodyes of Saints, Elias, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Tecla,</hi> should be all honoured with like and equall honour; as that neither <hi>Elias,</hi> nor <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor <hi>Tecla</hi> could be honoured more or in any greater degree then the dead body of a Saint, nor that they could be honoured one more then another, which were absurd
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:15521:184"/> to say; for as there may be difference of their degree of merit, or participation of the diuine excellency; so may also the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and measure of their honour be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: to which purpose the Apostle sayth of the glory of Gods Saints 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>That as one starre differs from another in brightnes, so shal it be in the resurrection of the dead.</hi> And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour also sayth <hi>Ioan.</hi> 14. <hi>That there are many mansions in the house of his Father;</hi> giuing to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that there are different degrees of glory amongst the Saints in respect of their different merits, whyles they were heer on earth; and for this cause the Church doth solemnize the feasts of Saints with great difference, honouring some more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet all as creatures, and seruants of God; in which respect the kind of honour that is giuen them is all one, but the degree and measure thereof is different.</p>
            <p n="28">28. The like is also euident in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall honour due to a King and his subiects; for the King is honoured with kingly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to none but to himselfe, and the subiects are honoured with an inferiour honour, such as may be giuen to subiects, and the same also in a different degree, to some more, and to some lesse, as their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quality, or the Kings pleasure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:15521:184"/> and the greatest honour of all, next to the King is giuen to the Kings Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet as to a subiect; Euen so I say of the honour due to God, and to his Saints, and seruants; for the honour due to him, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and peculiar to himselfe, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that is done to his Saints and seruants is of another kind, not extending it selfe further then to the consideration of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom he will haue to be honoured; and yet within that limit, the degree of honour is different according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent merits, and glory resulting thereon: and because the Blessed Virgin is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God, and thereby farre surpasseth them all in dignity and merit, the honour due to her is of far higher degree, and yet of infinite distance from diuine honour, as much as is betwixt the Creatour and the creature; so as neither the Saintes liuing, nor dead, nor the Mother of God herselfe is adored in the sense that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth it, that is to say with diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and therefore <hi>M. Collins</hi> his glosse hitherto is most false, and absurd.</p>
            <p n="29">29. I omit certaine other impertinent fooleryes of his, not worth the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and much lesse the answering. To come to his <hi>Achilles,</hi> I meane to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:15521:185"/> which he thinketh doth ouerthrow vs horse and foote, and therefore he bids me <hi>arrige aures Pamphile;</hi> albeit insteed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he might haue done well to haue made vse of his <hi>Epphata,</hi> to open my eares; but I hope to stop his mouth with <hi>Obmutesce.</hi> Wel then you shal heare his whole discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se; thus he sayth <hi>pag.</hi> 393. <hi>lin.</hi> 7. <hi>Yet let vs goe on with Epiphanius,</hi> a step further, <hi>Coluerunt enim &amp; adorauerunt creaturam praeter Creatorem</hi> &amp;c. <q>It is a trespasse with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the creature, or to adore the creature (for he puts both) <hi>praeter Creatorem,</hi> besydes the Creatour, that is, though you exclude not the worship of the Creatour, but only take in the worship of the creature: <hi>si enim Angelos adorari non vult, quanto magis eam quae ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita est ab</hi> Anna? <hi>&amp;c. non tamen aliter genita est praeter hominum naturam; sed sicut omnes ex se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine viri, &amp; vtero mulieris.</hi> Heere, heer, <hi>arrige aures Pamphile,</hi> heer you should do wel to list a whyle, you <hi>Poliphilus,</hi> or rather <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> of all bastard Deityes. For if, sayth he, God will not haue the Angells worshiped, how much more will not be haue her which was borne of <hi>Anna,</hi> &amp; yet not borne other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, then the fashion is, and nature of all mankynd; but &amp;c. Two great poynts assoyled by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in these few words;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:15521:185"/> one, that the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued nor borne after extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the <hi>Iesuits</hi> affirme, but euen as others are, which must needs be in sinne, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Another, that she is not so exalted in heauen, but inferiour to Angells, or els the consequence were not good; <hi>if not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells much lesse Mary the daughtes of Anne.</hi>
               </q> Thus hath <hi>Collyns</hi> spit out his spyte against the blessed Virgin to impugne her immaculate purity, &amp; the transcendent degree of glory which she worthily possesseth in heauen.</p>
            <p n="30">30. But first to say somewhat though very briefly, to his preamble therto; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he obserueth out of S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that he held it for <hi>a trespasse</hi> to <hi>worship or adore the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture besides the Creatour, that is,</hi> sayth he, <hi>to take in the worship of the creature, though we exclude not the worship of the Creatour,</hi> there is no doubt, but that it is most true; for God is a iealous God, and cannot endure to haue any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or companions in diuine adoration, that is to say, that any shalbe adored for God, or with diuine honour besides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and therefore he sayth of all kind of Idolls <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Non adorabis ea, ne{que} coles, ego sum Dominus Deus tuus, fortis, zelotes &amp;c.</hi> Thou shalt not adore them, nor worship them, I am thy Lord God, strong, and iealous.
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:15521:186"/> And againe, <hi>Exodus</hi> 34. <hi>Noli adorare Deuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienum, Dominus zelotes nomen eius.</hi> Do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore a strange God, a iealous Lord is his name; and what doth S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in effect say more then this? For speaking there of the ould errour as he calleth it of the Pagan Idolatours, he sayth: <hi>Coluerunt &amp; adoraue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt creaturam praeter Creatorem, &amp; stulii facti sunt,</hi> they worshipped and adored the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture besides the Creatour, &amp; became fools; for whether a man do worship Idols to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with God as the Kinges of <hi>Israell</hi> did, or alone without him, as the Pagans did, he committeth most abominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and becomes a foole; and when <hi>M. Collins</hi> shal proue that we do either of both, we will grant that S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> taxeth vs iustly both of folly and Idolatry, no lesse, then the ould Idolatours, or the <hi>Collyridian</hi> women against whome he wrote; and in the meant tyme M. <hi>Collins</hi> proues himselfe to be a notable foole to alleadge, and vrge this discourse of S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> against vs, whome it no way concerneth.</p>
            <p n="31">31. But now to come to his doughty ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumēt, which is this: <hi>If God wil not haue</hi> (saith Saint <hi>Epiphanius) the Angells to be adored, how much more will be not haue her, that was borne of</hi> Anna, <hi>&amp; yet not borne otherwayes, then according
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:15521:186"/> to the nature of all mankind, but euen as all others are by the seed of a man, and by the wombe of a woman.</hi> Thus indeed sayth <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> prouing very well and substantially, that which we do not deny, to wit, that the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin being by nature inferiour to Angells, is not to be adored with Godly honour, because the Angells cannot be so adored, neuertheles I would willingly know of <hi>M. Collins</hi> heere by the way, whether he wil say that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> denyed heerby, that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells might be adored in any sense, seeing that is most euident (and that holy Father could not be ignorant of it) that <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> and <hi>Iosue</hi> adored Angels prostrate vpon the ground <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. <hi>&amp; Iosue</hi> 5. as I haue signifyed before; therefore <hi>M. Collins</hi> must either admit a diminitiue adoration (as he tearmeth it) or charge those holy men with Idolatry, and S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> with ignorance, and errour, in forbidding the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of Angels warranted by examples in holy Scripture. But taking <hi>adoration</hi> heer as <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> meant it, for diuine honour, it is most true, that Angells are not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, because their nature is not capable of diuinity, or diuine honour, and much lesse the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who is by nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour both to them, &amp; to men; in which
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:15521:187"/> respect <hi>S. Epipha.</hi> also made the like argumēt before, <hi>à maiori ad minus,</hi> betwixt men &amp; her; that because men who were by nature su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to her, cannot be worshipped with diuine honour, much lesse could she be, &amp; the reason is all one in both.</p>
            <p n="32">32. And therefore <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> vrgeth heere expresly, that the Blessed Virgin was not other wayes borne, then after the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner of all mankind, to shew that his Argument is grounded only vpon the nature of men, and Angells; whereby the consequence is very good, that the Blessed Virgin cannot be adored as God, because her nature is lesse capable of diuinity, then is the Angelicall nature, which can admit no such adoration; so as for this point there was no great need that <hi>Maister Collins,</hi> should say to me <hi>arrige aures Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile:</hi> and indeed it seemeth he thought so himselfe, for he doth not much enforce or vrge it, thogh it is that which most cōcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the present question; but he hath found out two other points (yea, <hi>two great ones</hi> as he tearmeth them) and sayth they are assoyled by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in these few words; <hi>One,</hi> sayth he, <hi>that the Virgin Mary was not conceaued, nor borne after extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (as the Iesuits affirme) but euen as others are,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:15521:187"/> which must needs be in sinne, and corruption.</hi> This is the first point, which neuerthelesse you must vnderstand to be his owne inference vpon Saint <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and not any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence drawne by that holy Father, who doth not any way cal in question, &amp; much lesse impugne, the immaculate purity of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Now then <hi>M. Collins</hi> his argument must be this. The Virgin was conceaued, and borne after the ordinary manner of al men and women, <hi>Ergo</hi> she was borne in sin and corruption; and to make good his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (which I will deny) he will say, no doubt, that the ordinary manner of the conception, and birth of all men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men according to <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, and borne in sinne, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was also conceaued and borne in sin; but I will still deny his argument, and tell him that <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> will teach him how to distinguish the ordinary manner of her conception, and birth; for he signifyeth plainely, that his meaning was no other, but that she had both a Father, and Mother by whome she was engendred, and procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as all other children are, but whether in sinne, or without sin, he neither sayth, nor insinuateth so much as a word; for he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:15521:188"/> sayth only: <hi>That she was borne of</hi> Anna, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

            <p n="38">38. Now then to returne to his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of S. <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> you may iudge by this vniforme and constant doctrine of the ancient Fathers touching the inconta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate purity of this glorious Virgin how impiously he hath argued, that she was cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, and borne in sinne, and corruptiō, because <hi>S.

Iohn Baptist,</hi> who neuertheles were purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; sanctifyed in their Mothers wombe, by the testimonyes both of Scriptures, and Fathers; wherupon I say it followeth that seeing it was conuenient (as <hi>S.

Virginis cap.</hi> 18.) <hi>that the Blessed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,</hi> who was to be the Mother of God, <hi>should shyne, and be endowed with so great a purity, as a greater vnder God cannot be imagined,</hi> a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sanctificatiō was due to her, then either to those Prophets of God, or to the very Angels: in which respect the 7. <hi>Synod act.</hi> 3. doth style her not only <hi>immaculatam, imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate,</hi> but also <hi>omni sensibili, &amp; intellectuali <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:15521:191"/> puriorem,</hi> more pure then any sensible or intellectuall nature. Loe then, how one of the two great points, which <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayth is assoyled by <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> proueth to be a very little point, and not worth a pynne, only it hath serued to discouer his beastly, and blasphemous humour in labouring in vayne to stayne the vnspotted purity of the most blessed and glorious Mother of God.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Now let vs examine the other great point which he inferreth vpon <hi>S. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> his words, that the Blessed Virgin is not so exalted in heauen as we belieue she is, but that she is inferiour to Angells; and this he sayth because <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that if God will not haue Angells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored, much lesse will he haue her to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored which was borne of <hi>Anna,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon M. <hi>Collins</hi> sayth: <hi>That if she were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to Angells, the consequence were not good, if not Angells much lesse Mary the daughter of Anna.</hi> So indeed argueth he, but not S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in that sense, whose consequence is very good to the purpose he maketh it, but not as M. <hi>Collins</hi> applyeth it. You heard before the force of this consequence which S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> drew from that ground; to wit that because the nature of Angels was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:15521:192"/> of diuinity, and consequently of diuine adoration, therefore the nature of the blessed Virgin being inferiour to the nature of Ang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ls, was lesse capable of both, whereupon it followeth that she is neyther God, nor to be adored with diuyne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but how doth this make her now inferiour to Angells in glory, seeing shee is not glorifyed by nature, but by grace, whereof there is neyther mention, not question in this place of S. <hi>Epiphanius?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">41. For albeyt she could not be God eyther by nature, or by grace, yet she might be, yea and was by grace capable of glory according to the measure of the grace, wherwith Almighty God did endow her, and therefore for as much as she was not only <hi>gratia plena,</hi> ful of grace, and <hi>blessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong al women</hi> by the testimony of the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> but also dignified with a greater title of honour then euer any creature had, being made the mother of God (whereby she was both more neere, and deere to God her sonne then any other creature) therefore she is most worthily exalted in glory aboue all creatures, as well Angels as men.</p>

S. <hi>Ephraem</hi> in a most eloquent orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he made of her, entitleth her: <hi>The vncorrupt and most pure Virgin Mother of God, Queene of all men, more sublime, and high then the heauenly inhabitants: more honourable then the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubim, more holy then the Seraphim, and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious without comparison, then all the rest of the heauenly Armyes; the hope of the Fathers; the glory of the Prophets; the prayse of the Apostles; the honour of the Martyrs; the ioy of the Saints, the crowne of the Hierarchies, of all Saints, and Virgins; inaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for thy brightnes; the princesse &amp; guide of all men; a most sacred Mayd; by thee we are reconciled to Christ my God.</hi> So he, who doth also inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te her with exceeding deuotion &amp; feruour thus: <hi>Crebris te lachrymis ò celeberrima Materim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploro</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I implore, or inuocate thee O most renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mother, &amp; to thee I prostrate my self (O my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) humbly crying vnto thee, lest thy sweet sonne, the giuer of life to all, may, for many sins which I haue committed, take me out of the world, and cut me wretch vp by the roots, like the barren figge tree.</hi> So sayth this ancient, and holy Father.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Lastly <hi>S. Gregory</hi> the great vpon 4. <hi>Reg. cap.</hi> 1. affirmeth that, <hi>The blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin (to the end that she might arriue to the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eternall VVord) did rayse the top of her merits aboue all the quyres of Angells, vntill she came
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:15521:193"/> to the throne of the Deity.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> giuing to vnderstand, that she merited so much by the grace which God gaue her, to make her his Mother, that she was eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in glory aboue all Saints and Angels to be next to the Deity.</p>
            <p n="48">48. I omit many other testimonyes of the ancient Fathers for breuityes sake; for what need I alledge such ancient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, when I haue a moderne testimony that may suffice, seeing I am sure <hi>M. Collins</hi> neither will, nor dare reiect it, I meane the euident assertion of the Kings Maiesty, who in his Apology for the Oath <hi>pag.</hi> 37. sayth thus: <hi>First, for the Blessed Virgin Mary, I yield her that which the Angell</hi> Gabriell <hi>pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of her, and which in her Canticle she prophesyed of her selfe, that is, that she is blessed amongst all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and that all generations shall call her Blessed. I reuerence her, as the Mother of Christ, of whome our Sauiour tooke flesh, and so the Mother of God, since the diuinity, and humanity of Christ are inseparable. And I freely confesse, that she is in glory both aboue Angells, and men, her owne sonne (that is both God, and man) only excepted.</hi> Thus sayth his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.</p>
            <p n="49">49. Heere then, heer <hi>arrige aures,</hi> good <hi>M. Collins</hi> (as you sayd to me a little before) heere, I pray you, lay your hand on your
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:15521:194"/> hart, and examine your conscience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your beliefe agreeth with his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styes in this point, yea, and how well you haue performed his Maiestyes will, and commandement, who you say gaue you in charge to confute me; but I thinke his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestyes meaning was not, that you should also confute him, against whome your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is as valide, and potent, as against me: so as it seemeth your beliefe (at least in this point) is flatte contrary to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styes.</p>
            <p n="50">50. For his Maiesty belieueth as these ancient Fathers, whome I haue alleadged, and we Catholikes, and all good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do, that the most glorious Mother of God is glorifyed not only aboue all men, but also aboue all Angells; but you belieue, and labour to proue by the authority of <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> that she is inferiour in glory to Angells, yea to men; for so it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, if your argument were ought worth; for S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth not say that she is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to Angells otherwayes then in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the same he affirmeth also of her in regard of men, to whome he sayth she is also inferiour in nature, by reason of her sexe; if therfore she be inferiour in glory to Angels, because she is inferiour to them in
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:15521:194"/> nature, she is by the same reason inferiour also to men in glory; &amp; so should the theef that after a most wicked life, was saued in the end by the aboundance of Christs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, be more glorifyed now in heauen, then she, albeit she was alwayes immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and spotles, replenished with grace &amp; all vertues, and chosen amongst all creaturs to be the Mother of God. Doth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence please you <hi>M. Collins?</hi> And yet this must follow of your argumēt, if it be good, therefore I remit it to the Readers iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how well you vnderstand S. <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> from whome you draw such an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and absurd conclusion, as to make the Blessed Mother of God inferiour to Angels in glory, because she is inferiour to them in nature, whereby you also contradict not only the ancient Fathers of the Church, but his Maiesty also, yea and most impiously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the most Blessed Virgin, extenuating her glory much more then did those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks her enemyes called <hi>Antidicomarianitae,</hi> of whome I haue spoken before.</p>
            <p n="51">51. For if <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> accounted them to be heretiks, and her enemyes, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate her glory, because they taught that she had children by her lawfull husband after the birth of our Sauiour, that is to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:15521:195"/> say, because they did derogate from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her perpetuall virginity, what would he say of you <hi>M. Collins,</hi> that seeke to spoyle her, not only of the honour that is done her in earth, but also of the eminent glory, &amp; soueraingty (as I may say) which she hath vnder her Son our Sauiour Christ in heauen, yea, &amp; do abase, and deiect her euen below the meanest Saints? He would no doubt say of you much rather then he did of them, that which I haue alleadged out of him before <hi>num.</hi> 5. to wit, <hi>That you out of the aboundance of an affected madnes, frame blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous opinions, open your mouth, and loose your tongue out of a wicked mind; and insteed of Hymnes and glory (which are due vnto her) inuent, and vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drunken, and contumelious speaches against her, whereas you should honour, and worship that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vessell;</hi> to this effect I say, he sayd of those blasphemous Heretikes: and the same he would doubtles say of you, who do her no lesse iniury if not more, then they, &amp; abuse him most abominably, in making him the author, or a fauior of your blasphemy, wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting his words to a farre other sense, then euer he meant, besides the iniury you doe not only to vs Catholikes at this day, but also to the Church of God, in charging vs with Idolatry, for yielding to her the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:15521:195"/> which the whole Church hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes approued, and exhibited vnto her.</p>
            <p n="52">52. Whereas our bookes written of that subiect, and our doctrine in scholes and pulpits, do proclaime vnto the world; and our consciences do witnes it betwixt God, and vs, that albeyt we honour her, as the mother of God (and consequently as one that is more worthy, and eminent in grace, and glory, then al Saints or Angells) yet wee hould, belieue, and teach that shee is no God, but a meere creature of God; neyther is the honour which the Church doth yeild her diuine honour, but such as may be giuen to a glorifyed creature whome God will haue to be honoured, according to the testimony of our Sauiour <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. <hi>Si quis mihi ministrauerit &amp;c.</hi> If any man serue me, my Father wil honour him, or make him to be honoured; which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is referred finally, and principally to God, for whose sake she is honoured in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the participation of the diuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and the aboundance of grace, wherewith God hath blessed her more then any other pure creature, so as we are so farre from dishonouring God in honouring her, that we do him speciall honour and seruice therin; for seeing he sayd to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:15521:196"/>
               <hi>qui vos recipit, me recipit, qui vos spernit, me spernit,</hi> he that receiueth you, receiueth me, he that despiseth you, despiseth me; much more will he account the honour, or dishonour done to his mother, to be done to himselfe, so as the honour be not diuine honour, called <hi>latria,</hi> proper to him alone, which we neuer giue her, and much lesse to any other Saint or angell.</p>
            <p n="53">53. This being so, and most manifest aswell in our doctryn, as in our practise, how impudent is <hi>Collins</hi> that would face vs downe, that we make her God, and that we cōmit Idolatry vnto her, yea and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleth vs therein with the Collyridian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as if <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> reproued vs no lesse then them; to which purpose <hi>Collins</hi> sayth of them, that they (no doubt) would say as we do now, <hi>that they stuck to the liuing God; and yet worshipt the Virgin as the notable instrumēt by a subordinate kind of deuotiō,</hi> which he would neuer say, if he had not a brazen face; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is flatly repugnāt to the expresse text of <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> who testifyeth clearely, as I haue already declared, that they sought to introduce her <hi>pro Deo,</hi> for God, and that therefore they adored her with sacrifice, which is <hi>cultus latriae,</hi> diuyne worship, and being giuen to any but to God is flat Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p n="54">
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:15521:196"/>54. But such is the craft &amp; sleight of the diuel the enemy of all mankynd that he allwayes couereth his malice with some pious pretext; and therefore enuying the honour that is done to gods Saints (and specially to the mother of God) impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the same by his instrumentes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour, and pretence to defend Gods honour: whereby it appeareth that you M. <hi>Collins</hi> are the true bloud of that wicked serpent, which seduced <hi>Eue,</hi> verifying in your selfe, that which Almighty God sayd vnto him, <hi>Ponam inimicitiam inter te &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lierem, semen tuum, &amp; semen ipsius, &amp; ipsa confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret caput tuum, &amp; tu insidiaberis calcaneo eius:</hi> that is to say, I will put enmity betwixt thee and the woman, thy seed, and her seed, and she shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lay wayt to her heele: which words of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, not only many other Fathers, but also S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in his discourse against those blasphemous Heretikes, witnesseth to be fullfilled in the Blessed Virgin, whom he expoundeth to be the woman that shall bruse and crush the head of the serpent; and further affirmeth that as <hi>Eue,</hi> was called <hi>Mater viuentium,</hi> the mother of the liuing, so the Blessed Virgin is also <hi>Mater viuentium,</hi> because she brought forth the Son of God,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:15521:197"/> who giueth true life to the world: and that therefore, as <hi>Eue</hi> was cause of death to men, so <hi>Mary</hi> was cause of life to men. Thus sayth S. <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> wherupon it followeth that all those which receaue life by Christ, the seed, and sonne of Mary (who taking flesh of her made himselfe our brother) ought to acknowledge her for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="55">55. Therefore it is no marueile, that all true Christians do honour and serue her as their Mother, like good children, and so much the more, by how much the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life which they haue receaued by Christ her Sonne, excelleth the corporall life which they haue by their carnall pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. And againe on the other side, it is no wonder, that the seeds of the serpent, following the nature, and will of their Father, do continually impugne her, and her children, labouring by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to disgrace and dishonour her &amp; them; whereby it appeareth, of what good brood you are <hi>M. Collins,</hi> who imitating the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent your Sire, <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="56">56. Pardon me good Reader, I beseech thee, if thou thinkest me ouer sharp with this blasphemous miscreāt, whose impiety and blasphemy against the most Blessed Virgin hath iustly kindled my zeale, and whetted my stile against him in defence of her honour, as well for the common obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that all good Christians haue vnto her, being the Mother of God, as also for the particuler deuotion, I am bound to beare her, for innumerable benefits and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours spirituall, and temporall, which I haue receaued of Almighty God by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, and speciall protection; in which respect I may iustly prayse, and thanke her with Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who concluding his Tragedy <hi>de Christo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiente,</hi> doth salute, and inuocate her with an elegant Hymne, whereof I thinke good to set downe part in Greeke, as he wrote it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ov haue seene how M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath behaued himselfe in his sixt Chapter, in answering my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections out of three Fathers of the first, and second rancke (according to my Lord of <hi>VVinchesters</hi> diuision) to wit, <hi>S. Basil, S. Ephraene,</hi> and <hi>S. Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> touching their beliefe, and practise (yea,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:15521:200"/> and the practise of the whole Church in their tyme) in praying to Saints; I will now passe to his seauenth Chapter, &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his frauds in answering some Fathers of the third ranke, that is to say, <hi>true Fathers</hi> and truly cyted, <hi>sed nihil adrem,</hi> but nothing to the purpose, as my Lord sayth; but how truly he sayth it, and how substantially, and sincerely <hi>M. Collins</hi> doth maintaine it, let the indifferent Reader iudge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Amongst other Fathers which the Cardinall cited in his Apology pag. 13. for prayer to Saints, and I alleadged in my Adioynder one, was <hi>S. Gregory Nissen,</hi> brother to <hi>S. Basill;</hi> who prayed expressly to <hi>S. Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> the martyr in an oration made publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckly in his feast, where he saith thus: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede &amp; deprecare &amp;c.</hi> Pray, and make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for vs to <hi>our common King and Lord, to obteyne vs grace</hi> &amp;c.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue this generall answer; that such prayers of the Fathers are but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and Rhetoricall speaches, after the manner of <hi>Orators,</hi> who in panegyricall, and funeral orations do commonly vse the figures of <hi>prosopopaeia</hi> and <hi>Apostrophe,</hi> speaking to dead men, as though they were liuing, yea, and to senselesse things, as S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>

               </gap> Easter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the confutation of this answer of my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> I vrged 4. reasons, whereof I will debate heere only one, to wit the 4. because the other three were more generall; whereas the 4. concerned particulerly the place of <hi>S. Gregory Nissen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleadged, and most imported for the decision of this question; which I beseech thee <hi>good Reader</hi> wel to note, that thou maist the better consider of the importance of it, &amp; of <hi>M. Collins</hi> his honest &amp; sincere dealing in answering it. Thus then I sayd in the 7. Chapter of my <hi>Adioynder, pag.</hi> 263. <hi>num.</hi> 8. <q>Lastly to put this matter out of all doubt, and to discouer the impertinent vanity of <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> in this poynt, let vs consider the circumstances of one of the places now heere in question, betwixt the Cardinall &amp; him, I meane the same place of <hi>S. Gregory Nissen</hi> which I haue layd downe before, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his oration made in the solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the feast of <hi>S. Theodorus</hi> the Martyr, wherein <hi>S. Gregory</hi> hauing first touched the great celebrity of the feast by the confluēce of all sorts of people, farre and neere, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to consider thereby how God
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:15521:201"/> rewardeth the iust man, not only in earth, and thereby also incyteth him further to aspyre to the lyke rewards by the imitation of the vertues of those whome God so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth; and to this end he discourseth amply of the great honour that was euery where exhibited to the reliques of martyrs, and particulerly of that holy Martyr in that place, and feast, elegantly declaring the magnificence of the Church where his feast was celebrated, adorned with excellent workemanship of all sorts, and namely with pictures, liuely expressing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularityes of his Martyrdome; wherin, by the way, we may note, the vse of the pictures of Saynts in Churches in those dayes, yea and that they were held to be very profitable for the instruction of the people, seeing that <hi>S. Gregory Nissen</hi> sayth also vpon this occasion: <hi>Solet enim pictura ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens in pariete l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>qui, maxime{que} prodesse:</hi> for the picture which is sylent vpon the wall, is wont to speak, and to profit exceedingly. So he giuing to vnderstand, that the sight of the picture, or paynted history did grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly edify the people, and styr them vp to the imitation of the Saynts vertues, and holy lyfe.</q> But to proceed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <q>After this the same Father relateth
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:15521:201"/> the feruent deuotion of the people, greatly desiring to approach to the tombe of the Martyr; <hi>Credens,</hi> sayth he, <hi>contrectationem eius esse sanctificationem, &amp; benedictionem,</hi> belieuing that the very touching of it would be a sanctification &amp; benediction; yea seeking to get but some of the <hi>dust</hi> about the tombe, esteeming the same <hi>as a thing of great pryce;</hi> &amp; if they could haue the good fortūe to touch the reliques themselues, he appealeth to their owne experience and knowledge, how prosperous and happy they would thinke themselues, and how they would imbrace the sayd reliques, kisse them, and apply them to their eyes, eares, and all the instruments of their senses. <hi>Deinde</hi> sayth he, <hi>deuotionis &amp; affectonis lachrimas Martyri &amp;c. And then powring forth teares of deuotion and affection to the Martyr, as though he were there whole, and aliue, they exhibite their humble petition vnto him, as to the seruāt of God, &amp; as one that being inuocated</hi> (for so signifieth the greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth what gifts soeuer he will.</hi> Thus sayth this ancient &amp; holy Father, &amp; then cōcludeth: <hi>ex hijs omnibus, ô popule pie, discite &amp;c. O pious, or godly people, learne by all this, that the death of. Gods Saynts, is honourable, and precious in his sight.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <q>All this I haue thought good to lay downe at large, first to confirme al that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:15521:202"/> which hath hitherto byn treated concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the custome of the Church at that tyme, not only in the veneration of holy reliques, but also in the expresse <hi>Inuocation</hi> of Saynts: secondly that this holy Father making all this discourse in the solemnity of that Martyrs feast, to styrre vp the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as well to deuotion towards God, and the Martyr, as to the imitation of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs vertues (for so he himself professeth) did highly approue all that which he hath heere related; and cōsequently when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the conclusion of the Oration he himself <hi>inuocated</hi> the Martyr, he did it of pure deuotion, and not of vayne ostentation of his eloquēce, not as a flanting Rhetoriciā, or Oratour, but as a Religious <hi>Deuine,</hi> and deuout Christian, a pious Pastour, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of his flock, to whome he preached, for whome he prayed, and whome he sought to moue by his owne example, to concurre with him in the <hi>Inuocation</hi> of the Martyr.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <q>Wherein also <hi>M. Andrews</hi> may if it please him note the word <hi>Inuocation</hi> vsed by this Father for prayer to the Martyr, of whome he sayth, that the people prayed vnto him, <hi>and called vpon him as the minister of God, and as one that receiued</hi> (or obtayned of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:15521:202"/> God) <hi>what gifts he would,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is say <hi>being inuocated;</hi> for I thinke <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> wil not deny that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greeke doth properly signify <hi>inuocare</hi> in Latin, and in English to <hi>inuocate.</hi> And therefore because he is so curious to runne to the Greeke in all occasions to examine our citations of the Greeke Fathers, I remit him heere to the Greeke; for that I haue byn in this no lesse (if not more) curious then he, hauing searched the old Manuscripts of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where I haue seene two written copyes of <hi>S. Gregory Nissen,</hi> both of them very ancient, and in them both haue found the Greeke words, as heere I haue layd them downe in the margent, with all the rest, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the Latin translation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope he can take no iust exception thereto.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Thus then sayd I in my Adioynder, and to all this what thinke you will <hi>M. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> say? <hi>Your fourth obseruation,</hi> sayth he, <hi>in the eight number, is</hi> petitio principij, <hi>&amp; the turning of the wheele, &amp; therfore I will not medle with it: let the Bishops answere be but applyed to your obiection, and it will salue it as before.</hi> So he. Professing plainely as you see, that he wil not meddle with it, because forsooth it is <hi>petitio principij,</hi> and as he tearmeth it <hi>the turning of the wheele,</hi>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:15521:203"/> which how true it is, I remit to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any man, that knoweth what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>petitio principij;</hi> for how do I <hi>petere principium</hi> or turne the wheele (as he calleth it) when I doe vrge the circumstances of the place, which is in question, to no other end, but to cōfute my Lords expositiō of it, which is thereby clearely confuted, it being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by all the circumstances by me alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that S. <hi>Gregory Nissen</hi> did pray to the Martyr S. <hi>Theodorus</hi> out of pure deuotion, and affection, and not for ostentation of eloquence, not as a Rhetoritian, or as an Orator (as my Lord affirmed of him, and other Fathers praying to Saints) but as a deuout Christian, and a pious pastour, &amp; teacher of his flocke to whome he spake, &amp; whose deuotion towards the Martyr, and inuocation of him he greatly approued and commended; and this is so manifest in the Oration it selfe (as appeareth by the circū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances layd downe by me) that M. <hi>Collin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> had indeed great reason not to medle with it, but to seeke some colour, or shift to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd it, albeit he could not haue found a more paultry &amp; improbable shift then this, to charge me with <hi>petitio principij,</hi> whereof there is not so much as any shew or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in all that which I vrged against my
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:15521:203"/> Lord; and therefore wheras <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayth as you haue heard, that the Bishops answer will salue the obiectiō, if it be but applyed vnto it, he could not for shame haue sayd so, if he layd downe my Text, as I doubt not but you haue euidently seene; yea and noted withall his notable fraud in concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, &amp; refusing to answere it vpon such a friuolous, and false pretence.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But will you see how this fellow will play, as they say, small game rather then sit out? For although he sayd that he will not meddle with my obiection, yet he hath found somewhat to descant vpon, which I would let passe for a meere foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, but that there is notable fraud, and falsity in it. You haue seene before in the Abridgment, which I layd down out of S. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> Oration, that I noted by the way the vse of the Pictures of Saints in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in those dayes, &amp; that they were held to be very profitable for the instruction of the people, seeing that S. <hi>Gregory</hi> hauing signifyed that the Saints martyrdome was painted vpon the walls, added, <hi>Solet etiam pictura tacens in pariete loqui, maxime{que} prodesse.</hi> For euen the picture which is silent vpon the wall, is wont to speake, and to profit very much. Wherupon M. <hi>Collins</hi> taketh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

               </gap> Authors that he hath occasion to deale with, whereof wee haue seene safficient proofe already, and shall now see so much more, as no man would imagine could passe from any mans pen in so little space, to wit, in lesse then two pages, whereof, good Reader, I will desire no other Iudge but thy self, be thou neuer so partiall to <hi>M. Collins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. It is therfore to be vnderstood, that yt was his pleasure to take occasion of my foresaid Parenthesis, touching pictures, &amp; to make a large digressiō, for the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation therof, labouring to proue, that the vse of pictures in the Church, &amp; especially of Almighty God is vnlawfull. And first he beginneth with a place of S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> alleadging in his margent <hi>Tom.</hi> 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and because the place seemed to me some what strange, especially with his glosse, and interpretation of it, I was desirous to see it in the Father himself, and not fynding any where in our Latyn editions 7. Tomes of him, or yet that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which M. <hi>Collins</hi> citeth, I sought for the Greeke Edition of Syr <hi>Henry Sauill,</hi>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:15521:204"/> (whome I thought he was most like to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) and found there indeed, that Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> workes were distributed by him into 8. Tomes, and in the 7. I found the Oration which <hi>M. Collins</hi> cyteth, and hauing well considered the title, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the drifte, and the particuler cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances as well of the whole oration, as of the place, and words which he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth; I assure thee <hi>(good Reader)</hi> I was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to see the impudency of the man, who is not ashamed to wrest that holy Fathers words, to a farre different sense, then euer he meant them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. For the Father seeketh only in that Oration to cure the disease (as he tearmeth it) of such as being ouer curious, busy, and bould to search into the incomprehensible mysteries of gods infinite wisdome, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and iudgments, are scandalized, because they cannot penetrate, and sound the inscrutable depth thereof, whose folly therefore, and audacious curiosity he shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely reprehendeth, &amp; amongst many other Arguments, which he vseth to confound them, he proposeth the exāple of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim, who are described in the holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to stand before the throne of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne Maiesty, couering their faces with
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:15521:205"/> their wyngs, to signify thereby, that the diuyne essence is so incomprehensible, and his iudgments so impenetrable, that those pure, and celestiall spirits dare not so much as behold his face; wherupon <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> inferreth, that those men who presume to diue into the bottomelesse depth of the diuyne prouidence, are exceedingly auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and temerarious; but in all this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he hath not so much as one word of pictures, or of paynting: whereas <hi>M. Collins</hi> maketh him inueigh most bitterly against such as had pictures of the <hi>Seraphim,</hi> for thus he sayth <hi>pag.</hi> 256. <hi>lin.</hi> 9. <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi>
               <q>of them that would haue the pictures of the <hi>Seraphim,</hi> because they appeared in such, and such forme, <hi>Esay</hi> 6. which is your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pretence at this day, why God should be paynted (not the <hi>Seraphim</hi> only but God; a most monstrous shame) <hi>non te defodis? art thou not ashamed, O thou wretch,</hi> sayth he, <hi>of such a grosse collection? why doest thou not rather run vnder the ground, &amp; bury thy self alyue?</hi> And he addes in the same place, that the <hi>Seraphim</hi> are said <hi>to couer their faces with their wyngs at the appearance of God,</hi> only to shew that God is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible; yet you paynt them for theyr wings, wheras their wings are giuen them by the holy Ghost, sayes <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> to shew
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:15521:205"/> the secrecy, and that it must not be <hi>paynted,</hi> which cannot so much as be comprehēded.</q> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins,</hi> most shamefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> peruerting his sense, &amp; corrupting his Text, in so much that three notable fraudes may be noted in these few lynes. For, first he sayth that <hi>S. Chrys.</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, &amp; treateth of those that would haue picturs of the <hi>Seraphim,</hi> for this special rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>viz.</hi> because they haue appeared in such &amp; such forme <hi>Esay</hi> 6 al which is flatly false; for there is no mention at all in that place, of the picture of the <hi>Seraphim,</hi> &amp; much lesse of the reason, why some would haue them, &amp; it seemeth that he addeth that reasō craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily of purpose, to wrest the place the more probably to our paynting of God in the forme wherin he hath appeared; which he therefore exaggerateth for <hi>a monstrous shame;</hi> though he himself may be ashamed of such a monstrous lye, as he hath made therein.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Secondly he not only applyeth the words which he alleadgeth out of S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> contrary to his meaning (to wit, to those, that would haue pictures of the <hi>Seraphim,</hi> of whom <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> speaketh not at all) but also he corrupteth his Text, making mentiō in a different letter, <hi>of a grosse collection,</hi> saying, <hi>Art thou not a shamed, O thou
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:15521:206"/> wretch of such a grosse collection,</hi> wherof there is no mention in S. <hi>Chrysostome?</hi> and this he doth most fraudulently to perswade the reader, that <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> condemned as well the reason of our painting God, and the <hi>Seraphim,</hi> as the pictures themselues, albeyt <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> doth not so much as speake of eyther of both.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Thirdly, he falsifyeth also <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> notably afterwards in affirming that he sayes, <hi>that wynges were giuen to the Seraphim by the holy ghost, to shew the secrecy; and that it must not be paynted, which cannot be comprehended,</hi> whereas that holy Father, hath not one word of paynting eyther God, or the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi> or any thing else; and yet he setteth downe the word <hi>paynted</hi> in a different let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a word specially to be noted in <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> which is rather to be noted in M. <hi>Collins</hi> for a notable fraud and consenage of his Reader; besides that his folly also appeareth in that this falsification of his, is to no purpose: for put the case that <hi>S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> had sayd, as he maketh him say, <hi>viz.</hi> that it cannot be paynted which cannot be comprehended, yet it could not touch vs for paynting the forme, wherein God hath appeared, seing that we do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by paynt his Deity (which is indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:15521:206"/> and therefore cannot be paynted) but we paynt only the forme, wherein it hath pleased him to appeare, which forme is both comprehensible, and visible; so as it is euident that this silly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hath neyther honesty nor wit: no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty in that he corrupteth and falsifieth <hi>S. Chrysostomes</hi> text, no les then his sense; no wit, in doing it so ridiculously, as you see, without prouing any thing against vs, or helping his cause any thing at all.</p>
            <p n="12">12. But to the end that the Reader may euidently see the falsity, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this place of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> I will set downe the Greeke text of the Father heere in the Margent out of Syr <hi>Henry Sauils</hi> editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is in English thus:<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note>
               <hi>VVhy doest thou not hide and bury thy selfe in the bowells of the Earth, that with so great temerity wilt search into the prouidence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable &amp; inenarable power of God, incomprehensible euen vnto the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour powers? for all thinges that belong to him, are fully manifest on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, and to none els.</hi> These are the words of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> which I pray you confer with that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:15521:207"/> which M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath layd downe in a different letter for S. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Text (or for the substance therof at least) and you will cleerely see the difference; and that S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> doth addresse his speach to those only that presume to search into the mysteryes of Gods prouidence, without mention of Pictures, either of the <hi>Seraphim</hi> or of any thing els, and much lesse of any <hi>gresse collection</hi> touching the same.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Therefore I will now conclude this point with <hi>M. Collins</hi> his owne words applying them to him as he wel deserueth: <hi>Non te desodis? Art thou not ashamed, O thou wretch</hi> (Collins) <hi>at such a grosse falsification of a holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Doctour of Gods Church? VVhy doest thou not rather runne vnder the ground, and bury thy selfe aliue?</hi> This truly may be worthily sayd to this shameles wretch, who hath neither conscience, nor shame; for if he had, he could not possibly haue committed such a willfull corruption, and malicious falsity, as heer he hath done, yea &amp; added so many more, as you shall see now in that which followeth.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>After this place of</hi> S. Chrysostome, <hi>he alleadgeth another out of a</hi> Synod <hi>held at</hi> Constantinople <hi>thus:</hi>

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:15521:207"/> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which <hi>Maldonate</hi> your fellow-Iesuit in his Comment vpon <hi>Daniel,</hi> answereth thus: That the Fathers in that Councell were not rightly instructed, &amp; the Church saw more vpon better consideration in after tymes: <hi>Yet you make vs belieue that you reuerence the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and we censure them.</hi>
               </q> Thus sayth M. <hi>Collins;</hi> wherin I wish to be noted two things; the one that what he alleadgeth &amp; affirmeth of <hi>Maldonate,</hi> I find not in his Cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon <hi>Daniel,</hi> and therfore if his note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>booke haue deceaued him, and that he find it somewhere els, I wil answere it heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when he shall produce it. The other is a notable fraud concerning his allegatiō of the Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi> cyted by him to impugne the vse of pictures in Churches, which vse neuerthelesse was ordayned expresly by that Synod, yea and by that selfe same Canon which he cyteth.</p>
            <p n="15">15. For albeit those Fathers that were assembled in that <hi>Synod,</hi> did not thinke it conuenient, that <hi>Christ</hi> should be paynted in the forme of a Lambe (which they thought more fit, and proper to the ould Testament, as a figure, and shaddow of Christ, then to the new, wherein the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is expressed) yet they so far allowed of the Image and picture of Christ himselfe,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:15521:208"/> in the true form of his humanity, that they ordayned the vse of it expresly, in their 82. Canon, which is the same wherin they forbad the paynting of the Lambe; for there it followeth immediatly thus: <hi>VVe command</hi> (sayth they) <hi>that heerafter the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, or forme of Christ our God, who taketh away the sinnes of the world, shall be set, or placed insteed of the old Lambe, to the end that we comprehending in our mindes the humility of the word of God, may be moued to remember his conuersation with vs in flesh, and his passion and death, and that the world was redeemed by him.</hi> Thus sayth that Canon, not only ordayning, as you see, the vse of our Sauiours picture, but also yielding the true reason, which hath euer moued the Church to vse the same.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And if this Canon will not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy <hi>M. Collins</hi> in this point, another may also be produced out of the same Councell much more to the purpose, to proue not ōly the vse of pictures, but also the adoratiō of them: I say the <hi>adoration,</hi> because <hi>M. Collins</hi> doth hardly brooke that word when it is applyed to pictures or Images, and yet it is vsed expresly by those Fathers in that Councel, to wit, in the 73. Canon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they signify, that for as much as the Crosse doth shew or signify vnto vs our
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:15521:208"/> saluation, we therefore ought to giue vnto it the honour that is conuenient. <hi>Quamobrē</hi> say they, <hi>&amp; mente, &amp; sermone, &amp; sensu, adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem ei tribuētes, Crucis figuras quae à nonnullis in solo, ac in pauimento fiunt, omnino deleri iubemus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>VVherefore we attributing vnto it adoration, both in mind, speach, and sense, do ordayne that the figures or formes of the Crosse (which by many are made in flooers, or pauements) be abolished, lest the Trophey of our Victory be iniured by the treading or trampling of those that goe vpon it; and therefore we decree, that those who shall heereafter make the signe of the Crosse vpon the ground, shall be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</hi> Thus sayd those Fathers in that Canon: so as you see <hi>M. Collins</hi> gaineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his allegation of this Councell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the vse of pictures, but that he hath notably intangled and disgraced himselfe thereby.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Neuerthelesse to doe him some pleasure, and to help him out of the bryers, I am content to acknowledge that this Councel of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which made these Canons, is of no force, being a schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Councell assembled, and held by the Schismaticall Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Callinichus,</hi> without any consent of the Roman, &amp; Westerne Church; besides that they ordayned, and made diuers erroneous
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:15521:209"/> Canons, among the which I am sure there are some, that <hi>M. Collins</hi> himselfe will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to be such, especially if he loue a blacke pudding; for they ordayned that if any man do eate bloud, or any meate dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed or made with it, if he be a Clergy man he is to be deposed, if a lay man, he is to be excommunicated; so as if this Canon be in force, <hi>M. Collins</hi> I thinke hath deserued to be deposed from the Clergy, and ministry many tymes.</p>
            <p n="18">18. I omit for breuityes sake, to lay downe other erroneous Canons of that Synod, which Venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> in whose tyme it was held, in his booke <hi>de sex aetatibus,</hi> and <hi>Paulus Diaconus de gestis Longobardorum lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. do worthily call <hi>Erraticam Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum:</hi> Witnessing further that neither Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> nor Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 7. nor Pope <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> could euer be induced either by force or flattery, or fraud to confirme the same; albeit <hi>Iustinian</hi> the yonger Emperour in whose pallace it was held, did persecute Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> for the same, in such sort that he made meanes to haue him taken, and brought prisoner to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and had effected it, if the Romans had not rescued and deliuered him.

            <p n="19">19. Now then, two things I hope are euident. The one, that it the authority of this Councell be ought worth M. <hi>Collins</hi> his cake is dow, aswell for the adoration, as for the vse of pictures. Secondly, that being the Councell valid, or voyd, he hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe a cogging companion in alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it contrary to the true intent, &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof: for although he sayth truly that those Fathers did forbid the paynting of a Lamb, yet they did it not to the end, &amp; purpose which he pretendeth (that is to say to forbid thereby the vse of Pictures) but because they thought that such a forme did not sufficiently and worthily expresse the humanity of our Sauiour, whome therfore
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:15521:210"/> they ordayned to be represented and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his owne forme and shape. Can any thing then be more for our purpose, or more against him? Thus much for this his fraud; which I am sure you will graunt to be a sound one; and so liberall is <hi>M. Collins</hi> in this kind, that he will not sticke to giue yet two or three more euen touching this matter of Pictures.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The next consisteth in his abuse of a place in S. <hi>Augustine</hi> which he wresteth in like manner against the vse of Pictures, whereas it doth notably proue the same. <q>Thus then he sayth pag. 257. <hi>You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what S. Augustine sayth de consensu Euangel. lib. cap,</hi> 10. <hi>Sic errare meruerunt qui Christum non in codicibus, sed in pictis parietibus quaesierunt.</hi> So they deserued to be mockt, that sought for Christ not in written bookes but in paynted walls.</q> Thus farre doth <hi>M. Collins</hi> alleadge S. <hi>Augustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="21">21. But now to discouer his cozenage therein, it is to be vnderstood that <hi>S.

The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore those gifts being set forth to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike view of all men, are most euident sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and testimonyes, that those which giue them are freed from their diseases, &amp; haue recouered their health. These I say, do shew what is the vertue or power of the Martyrs; and the power and vertue of the Martyrs doth declare, that he whome they haue worshipped and serued, is true God. Thus sayth <hi>Theodoret.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="45">45. <q>And can any man desire a more cleare, and manifest testimony, eyther that the generall custome of the Church was to pray to Saynts in his tyme, or that God approued it with miraculous effects? Yea, and that the same was held for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall argument to proue that <hi>Christ</hi> was God? Wherein also it is to be obserued, that the vse was in that age (about eleauen hundred yeares agoe) to hang vp votiue Images and representations of hands, feete, eyes, and such like, to testify the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous recouery of bodily health by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Saynts, which therefore is no
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:15521:213"/> moderne custome of these later ages (as our aduersaryes falsely affirme it to be) but an auncient practice of the primitiue Church. Wherupon it also followeth not only that prayer to Saynts is most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and honorable to almighty God, and profitable to men, but also that Saynts hear the prayers that are made vnto them, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they obtayne the grant thereof, and giue succour to the suppliants.</q> Thus said I in my <hi>Adioynder.</hi>

               </gap>eek to shift of this. The truth is, he vndertaketh to answere it, and that very amply, but with such falsehood, as thou wouldst wonder to see it, if thou hadst not seene so many, and so exorbitant all ready that now it wilbe no wonder vnto thee. First he seeketh to cast vpon me some sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of fraud, or falsity, saying <hi>pag.</hi> 273. <hi>nu.</hi> 23. <hi>VVhen I cast myne eyes,</hi> sayth he, <hi>vpon Theodorets owne text (not as you trenlace, and translate it at pleasure) I see very little to make for you, if ought at all.</hi> So he, seeming to charge me with some false translation, albeyt he sheweth nor wherein, eyther heere or els where, no not so much as of any one word; which he would infalliby haue done with
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:15521:214"/> no small tryumph, and insultation if he had found any.</p>
            <p n="29">29. But then he goeth forward and tells vs, that <hi>Theodoret reports only fashion, and vse, and that not general,</hi> which he sayth I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed in the text of my seauenth Chapter; wherein he saith truly (for so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth my promise) for indeed I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed there to shew euidently that the Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Saints was generally practised in the primitiue Church, as well by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, as by all other faythful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; to which purpose I produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst diuers other testimonyes this of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who sheweth it manifestly as you haue seene, vrging notably against the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims the great honour that was done gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to Martyrs at those dayes, to proue that Christ is God; and therefore whereas M. <hi>Collins</hi> tells his Reader, <hi>That Theodoret re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports only fashion, and vse, but not generall,</hi> he seekes to delude him egregiously.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Neuertheles this is but a <hi>peccadilio,</hi> in respect of that which followeth a few lines after in these words: <hi>Neither does The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret say that the people made their prayers to the Martyrs, but hauing spoken in the last wordes of the God of Martyrs, he addes immediatly of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for all such things as they stand in need of, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifieth
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:15521:214"/> not to whome they pray for them, whether to God, or to the Martyrs, to whome then rather then to the God of Martyrs?</hi> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins;</hi> but with what conscience you may easily iudg by reflecting a little vpon the place of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> set downe by me a little before, wher you see the flat contrary of that which he affirmeth; for wheras he sayth, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> doth not specify to whome they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you see that he sayth expresly, they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Martyrs (not as to Gods) but as to diuine men, beseeching them to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours for them; and to the end that there should be no doubt of the translation of <hi>Theodorets</hi> wordes out the Greeke, I did set downe the greeke Text in the margent of my Adioynder (as I haue done also heere) that the learned Reader might be the better satisfyed of the truth thereof.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Now then can any man thinke, that <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath any conscience at al, or any sparke either of grace, or honesty who saw this, and not only dissembled it, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so affirmed the quite contrary? Yet not content with this, he sayth also afterwards in the next page, that wheras <hi>Theodoret</hi> sayd that the poore way-fayring mē craued the Martyrs to accompany them in their way, he turned Rhetorical, and meant no other
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:15521:215"/> then only to oppose the exaltation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Saints to the Gentill Gods so farre, as was compatible with Christs true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and how proueth he this?

            <p n="23">23. For it proueth, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> did not turne Rhetoricall (as M. <hi>Collins</hi> tearmes it) that is to say, he did not speake rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly, by the way of Amplification, when
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:15521:215"/> he sayd, that the way-faring men craued the Martyrs to be their Companions in their way, but spake truly as he thought &amp; belieued, seeing that he declareth presently after, in what sort they and the other sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyants of the sayd Martyrs, craued their help, to wit, <hi>praying to them not as to Gods, but as to diuine men, beseeching them to be intercessours for them.</hi> Heerby also it appeareth what an impertinent and idle glosse he maketh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after vpon these wordes of <hi>Theodoret</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which he sayes, <hi>does not force that they prayed to the Martyrs to accompany them, whose company they might beg as well of God, and he licence them.</hi> So sayth he, but it appeares by that which you see is dissembled by him, that they prayed to the Martyrs themselues, though not as to Gods, but as to diuine men.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Lastly, wheras he sayth, that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> doth not distinguish betweene <hi>Dulia,</hi> and <hi>Latria</hi> (as my braynes crow) because he correcteth himselfe, saying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (that is to say, <hi>not comming to them as to Gods</hi>) I thinke he was no lesse brainles then shameles, when he wrot so; for albeit those greeke wordes alone (which he setteth downe) do not distinguish betwixt <hi>Dulia,</hi> and <hi>Latria,</hi> yet being connected, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:15521:216"/> with the other which immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (&amp; were by him shamfully dissēbled) they make a plaine distinctiō betwixt <hi>dulia</hi> and <hi>latria</hi> though not in formall words, yet in substance, and effect. For when <hi>Theodoret</hi> sayth, that those supplyants came not to the Martyrs as to Gods, he signifyeth plainely, that they did not giue to the Martyrs diuin honour which is <hi>latria,</hi> and is due to God alone; and when he addeth, <hi>that they prayed to them as to diuin men, beseeching them to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours for them,</hi> he gaue to vnderstand, that they exhibited vnto them an inferiour ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to Gods glorifyed seruants which we call <hi>Dulia,</hi> and is due to saints. So as you see how false &amp; found he is in euery thing.</p>
            <p n="35">35. But yet the silly fellow hath not the wit to make an end heere, but within foure lines after falleth vpon two other greeke wordes of the same sentence of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> to wit, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is to say, <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come intercessours,</hi> which he glosseth thus: As for <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>let the Saints pray for vs as much as you will, that is nothing to our question of praying to them.</hi> So he, whereas two other wordes which immediatly follow those that he alleadgeth, do vtterly cōfound him; for there followeth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, so as the sentence is, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, that is to say, and beseeching (them) to be intercessours for them; &amp; is this, trow you, nothing to our question of praying to those martyrs? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that the whole period being, as I haue sayd before (to wit, <hi>not comming to them as to Gods, but praying to them as vnto diuine men, and beseeching them to be intercessours for them</hi>) doth make the matter far more cleare, and doth conuince him of the most willfull, and malicious falshood, &amp; fraud that hath byn cōmitted by any writer of this age, thogh it aboundeth with men of his coate, and profession, that excell in that faculty.</p>
            <p n="36">36. But let vs yet see some more of his iugling. There followeth presently after in my Adioynder, a place of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in his book <hi>de cura pro mortuis,</hi> first alleadged by my Lord of <hi>VVinchester pag.</hi> 46. to proue that the Saints do not heare our prayers, or know our actions, because S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth that the dead are not present at the affayres of men; in answere wherof I sayd in <hi>pag.</hi> 291. <hi>num.</hi> 47. that his Lordship might haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that booke of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> which he cyteth, <hi>That albeit the dead do not naturally know what passeth in earth, neither are ordinarily conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with vs, yet they may know our actions as well by the relation of Angells, as by diuine reuelation, yea,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:15521:217"/> and that they may be present with vs, and help vs,</hi> per diuinam potentiam, <hi>by diuine power.</hi> Thus sayd I, alleadging for the same S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine, de cura pro mortuis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37. And will you now see, what <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayth to this? Truely he thought good to say somewhat to it, &amp; to do his best to proue that Saints: <hi>Do not know our prayers by the relation of Angells.</hi> But because he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that his reasons would weigh farre lesse in the iudgment of his Reader, if he should seeme to contradict <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> he thought it best to make no mentiō of him at al, but to lay all his battery against me, as though I alone had sayd it, and of my own head: so as now I must be beaten for S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> or rather he in my coate, &amp; skyn, but you, I thinke, will wonder what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent reasons could make this silly Doctour so confident as to contemne and impugne the authority of one of the greatest Doctors of Gods Church. You shall heare them, for albeit I had determined, and promised to meddle no more with his fooleryes, yet for as much as these are accompanied with a continuall fraud, in that he dissembleth &amp; impugneth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> his doctrine, throgh out the whole as if it were only myne, I hould my selfe obliged to answere for S.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:15521:217"/>
               <hi>Augustine,</hi> and withall as well to discouer his folly, as his fraud.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Thus then he sayth <hi>p.</hi> 276 <hi>n.</hi> 26. <hi>VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you say num</hi> 47. <q>that the Saints know our prayers by the relation of Angells. First, how shall the Angells know them to relate them? <hi>By reuelation from God,</hi> you will say: but he that reueales to the Angells might reueale to the Saints, <hi>eadem opera;</hi> what needs this reuelation then?</q>
               <hi>Sic fieri per plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, quod potuit per pauciora.</hi> Thus sayth this deepe Deuine, who you see demands how the Angells do know our prayers to relate them, and assures himselfe (as it seemes) that I will say, they know them by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="39">39. But truly he is much deceaued as sure as he makes himselfe; for albeit I doe not deny, but that they may know our prayers by reuelation, yet it were great fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thinke that they need reuelation to know those things which they see &amp; know by ordinary meanes. Hath not this great Doctour trow you, read in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>res <hi>Haebr.</hi> 1. that the Angells are all <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistratorij spiritus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ministring spirits sent for them, which shall receaue the inheritance of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> whereby he may vnderstand, that they are cōtinually imployed by Almighty God
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:15521:218"/> heere in earth for the benefit and good of his elect? Or can he be ignorant of that which our Sauiour himselfe doth teach vs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. to wit, that <hi>Angeli eorum</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Angells of his little ones do alwayes see the face of his Father, which is in heauen?</hi> Vpon which place and diuers others in the holy Scriptures (which I omit) the ācient Fathers do teach both the continuall presence of Angells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs, and also that euery man hath a proper Angell for his guardian or keeper.</p>
            <p n="43">43. So sayth <hi>S. Hierome lib.</hi> 3. <hi>comment. in Matth.</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose lib. de viduis. S. August. Tom.</hi> 10. <hi>serm.</hi> 8. <hi>de natali Domini. S.

Cassian. coll.</hi> 13. <hi>Cyril. contra Iulian. lib.</hi> 4. and to omit others, <hi>S. Bernard serm.</hi> 12. vpon the psalme <hi>Qui habitat;</hi> where he aduiseth vs to yeild to our proper Angells, <hi>deuotion for their beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, loue for their care, and reuerence for their presence, and continual assistance.</hi> Whereby M. <hi>Collins</hi> may fall into the account of his own beastly ingratitude, towardes his proper Angell, and all other holy Angells, seeing that he doth not acknowledge the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual benefits, that he and all other men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:15521:218"/> by them, but also blasphemously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth the respect, reuerence, &amp; honour that is due vnto them. Well then this being so, what need haue the Angels of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary reuelation from Almighty God, or know our prayers, and actions which they vnderstand, and see continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongst vs?</p>
            <p n="41">41. Furthermore he cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of a wilfull, and fraudulent dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>S. Augustins</hi> discourse in this place concerning this poynt, confirmed by him with the Authority of the holy Scripture, and therefore I think good to lay downe <hi>S. Augustins</hi> words heere. <hi>Possunt,</hi> sayth he, <hi>&amp; ab Angelis, qui rebus quae aguntur hic praesto sunt, audire aliquid mortui</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the dead may also heare by the Angells (which are present here at such things as are done) some such thing as he, to whome all things are subiect, doth iudge fit for euery one of thē to vnderstand, for if Angells could not be present in the places both of the liuing, and the dead, our Lord Iesus would not haue said thus: It came to passe that the poore man dyed, and was carryed by Angels into the bosome of Abraham; therfore they may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heere, and sometymes there who by the will of God carryed (Lazarus) from hence thither.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">42. And might not this haue sufficed
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:15521:219"/> to informe this Doctor that <hi>S. August.</hi> did not only hold that the Angells may know our actions by being present with vs, but also that he confirmed the same with the authority of Scripture? wherto if I should add al the places of the ould, &amp; new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which do testify the ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploymēts, &amp; ministery of Angels on earth &amp; their intercourse in humane affayres, it might seem incredible that a Doctor &amp; a publick professor of diuinity should be so ignorant of it, as to thinke that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know our prayers, but by reuelation.</p>
            <p n="43">43. But put the case yt were so, how would it follow that the reuelation were needles as he inferreth? Marry sayth he, because God might reueale to the <hi>Saints eadē operâ,</hi> and so auoyd the inconuenience of doing the things <hi>per plura, which may be done by pauciora.</hi> But how absurd, &amp; ridiculous is this? for so should all secondary causes cease, as needeles, because Almighty God might do all things by his omnipotent power, without vsing any instrument or meane; so then was it needeles and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, that an Angell should be sent to the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssed Virgin, or to <hi>Zacharias Luc.</hi> 1. or to <hi>S Ioseph;</hi> because God might haue reuealed his will vnto them himself imediately;
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:15521:219"/> so also was the ministery of Angels super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and needlesse, when they were imployed, and sent by Almighty God in the ould Testament to the Patriarches, &amp; Prophets; and to insist also vpon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample alleadged by <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> it was nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles that the Angels should carry the soule of <hi>Lazarus</hi> into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, whither Almighty God might haue transported it by his only will, or word, by the which he made heauen and earth, and all things els.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Finally, if M. <hi>Collins</hi> will tye Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to do nothing <hi>per plura,</hi> which he may doe <hi>per pauciora,</hi> he most needes confesse, that it was superfluous, and in vayn, that 7. dayes should be spent in the Creation of the world, which God might haue made in an instant; and the like may be sayd of our Redemption, and of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the Church: &amp; of the whole world, wherein wee see God doth effect very many things, or rather all things by the ministery of his seruants, and other Creatures, which he might do by his owne power immediately, if in his diuine wisdome he thought it conuenient.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Do you see then what a wise Doctor we haue, who argueth so substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:15521:220"/> as not only to deny to Almighty God the seruice, vse, and ministery of his Creatures (because he may do his will without them) but also to controle the manner of our Creation, and redemption, because <hi>frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora.</hi> But let vs see some more of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Secondly sayth he, <hi>VVho makes that the Angells worke to be offerers of our prayers to the Saints in heauen? Is this worthy of them? Is it a fit work to imploy Angells about?</hi> So he: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I answere, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> was belike much ouerseene in assigning to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells so meane an office: but perhaps the ouersight may be rather in M. <hi>Collins,</hi> who measuring the Angells by himself, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that those celestial spirits are as proud and vncharitable as he, who if he were an Angell (as he is neuer like to be, except perhaps some bad Angell, and one of the worst) he would disdaine to be so imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but seeing that their humility, &amp; cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is such, that they vouchsafe to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the guard and protection of men in earth (yea of the greatest sinners) S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> had great reason to think, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse not to do all the charitable offices, that are any way requisite for the good, and comfort of the elect, for whose saluation
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:15521:220"/> they are sent, and imployed heere in earth, as I signifyed before out of the Apostle to the <hi>Heb. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p n="46">46. But will you heare how he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and ouerthroweth him quite? He goeth forward thus: <hi>And surely if this be once entertayned, that the Angells acquaint the Saints with our prayers, which els they should not know but for them, will not the Pagan opinion which</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose hissed out (and you with him euen now) returne; that God should be ignorant also of our affayres vnlesse the Angells reuealed them? For you make the Angells to offer our prayers to God, to a iust reward of your peruerting so the Apocalyps cap.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. Thus sayth M. <hi>Collins</hi> like a deep Deuine and a terrible Logician, in so much that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> was neuer so put to his trumps by any aduersary of his (were he <hi>Manichaean, Donatist,</hi> or <hi>Pelagian</hi>) as he is now by <hi>M. Collins;</hi> but because <hi>S. Augustine</hi> cannot answere for himselfe, I will be so bould as to answere for him, and say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what briefly to this powerfull argument.</p>
            <p n="47">47. Therfore, first it is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth not, that the Saints cannot know our prayers but by Angells (as <hi>M. Collins</hi> seemeth falsely to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose) but that the Saints do not naturally know what is done in earth, and yet that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:15521:221"/> they may know it, either by the Angells, or by reuelation from Almighty God. And put the case that <hi>S. Aug.</hi> had sayd as <hi>M. Colli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> relateth that they do not know our prayers but by Angells, how would it follow, that the Pagan opinion (hissed out by <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>) would returne (to wit, that God should be ignorant of our affayres, if the Angells did not reueale thē to him?) Would any man be so absurd to thinke that the infinite wisedome, and knowledge of God doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way depend vpon the limitted know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Saints, or Angells, and to inferre thereupon, that God cannot know some thinges without the reuelation of Angels because the Saints cānot? VVho euer heard the like inference? Which therefore may wel be hissed out with the Pagan opinion, and <hi>M. Collins</hi> also, for supposing, that any Christian man would be so simple, and absurd to make it.</p>
            <p n="48">48. Yea, but (sayth he) you make the Angells to offer our prayers to God too? What then <hi>M. Collins?</hi> VVill that bring in the Pagans opinion, that God can know nothing but by Angells? We make also the Priest (when he offereth sacrifice at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar) offer vp our prayers to Almighty God, and must we needes thinke therefore that
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:15521:221"/> God could not know them but by him? The office of the Bishops, &amp; Priests in the ould Law was to offer to God the sacrifice, and prayers of the people (as mediatours betwixt God and them) but was there euer any so ridiculous to thinke, that they did it, because God could not other wayes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the necessityes and prayers of the people but by them? Yet this forsooth is the Club, wherwith this great <hi>Hercules</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to beat downe <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="49">49. But what he meaneth by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, That this is a iust reward of our peruerting the <hi>Apoc. cap.</hi> 5. <hi>vers.</hi> 8. I know not for my part, neither how we peruert that place in the Apocalyps, neither how we are rewarded for it; the place is cleare to proue that the Angells offer vp the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the holy men on earth, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> himself, saying that the 24 <hi>Seniors</hi> had euery one golden <hi>Phialas, plenas odoramentorum, quae sunt orationes sanctorum,</hi> full of sweet odours, which are the prayers of the holy; which words can haue no other litterall sense, but that the Angells offer to God, <hi>orationes Sanctorum, the prayers of holy men.</hi> So as M. <hi>Collins,</hi> and his fellowes may be ashamed to deny it (what mysticall sense soeuer is, or may be drawne out of it) ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:15521:222"/> when he shall tell vs, what other lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall sense it hath, and how we peruert it, I will answere him further.</p>
            <p n="50">50. In the meane tyme he may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand if it please him, that it is no new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynion of the Catholicks at this day, that the Angells do offer vp our prayers to God, seeing that <hi>S. Hilary</hi> teacheth it in his expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the <hi>Psalme</hi> 129. alleadging the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Angell <hi>Raphael</hi> in <hi>Tobias:</hi> the like doth <hi>S. Hierome</hi> vpon the 10. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> expounding the Angels wordes to <hi>Daniel</hi> thus: <hi>I am that Angell, which offers thy prayers to God.</hi> Also <hi>S Augustine</hi> in his <hi>Epist</hi> 120. <hi>cap.</hi> 92. affirmeth expresly that the Angells doe not only signify the benefits of God to vs, but also represent our prayers to him: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to omit others, <hi>S. Bernard serm.</hi> 7. <hi>in Cantica,</hi> sayth: <hi>Credimus sanctos Angelos</hi> &amp;c. <hi>VVe belieue that the holy Angells are present with men when they pray, and offer their prayers to God.</hi> Therfore to conclude this point, 2. things are euident heerein; the one, that <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath impugned <hi>S. Augustine</hi> most ridiculou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly, and childishly; the other that he hath done it with great fraude, and craft vnder my name only, whereas the discourse and doctrine which he taxeth, is <hi>S. Augustines,</hi> &amp; as his only alleadged and related by me.</p>
            <p n="51">
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:15521:222"/>51. The like he hath done also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with much more fraud, touching another place of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in the same booke, <hi>de cura pro mortuis,</hi> which I cyted in my Adioynder to proue the apparition of Saints, and the help they affoard to their supplyants; the occasion was, that the Cardinall alleadged the words of <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> testifying the apparition of <hi>S. Felix</hi> in the siege of <hi>Nola,</hi> thus: <hi>Audiuimus non incertis rumoribus, sed certis testibus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>VVe haue heard not by vncertaine rumours, but by assured witnesses, that the Confessour Felix hath appeared not only by the effects of benefits, but also to the sights of men.</hi> Thus farre the Cardinall alleadgeth Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> wordes. VVhereto my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> answered in his Apology <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 178. that, <hi>de Felice Augustinus nihil praeter auditum habet</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Concerning Felix Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine hath nothing but by hear-say, and whether it were done by the very presence of the Martyrs, or by Angells taking the shape of the Martyrs vpon them, or perhaps by both these wayes,</hi> Augustine <hi>dare not determine, so vncertaine is he touching this question of apparitions.</hi> Thus sayd my Lord: wherto I replyed in my Anioyder, that it appeared euidently by the wordes of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recyted, that he giueth another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of assurance of this apparition, then my
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:15521:223"/> Lord acknowledged in his answere, who maketh it a matter very vncertayne, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon a bare <hi>heare-say,</hi> whereas <hi>S. Augustine</hi> excludeth all vncertainty of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and fortifyeth his relation, with the testimonyes of assured witnesses. Thus sayd I, <hi>pag.</hi> 394. <hi>num.</hi> 42.</p>
            <p n="52">52. And now that you may see how substantially M. <hi>Collins</hi> answereth this, and how faythfully he relateth the substance of my reply, you shall heare his owne words; <q>thus then he sayth <hi>pag</hi> 383. <hi>num.</hi> 20. To your <hi>numb.</hi> 42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 43. What we heare from wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, yet we do but heare, when you haue made the most of it, so as the Bishop might well say: <hi>Augustinus nihil praeter auditum habet, Augustine</hi> hath nothing more then hear-say, meaning, he reports not this of his owne knowledge, though he would not seeme to deny credit to those witnesses; which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man to say truth is loth to do, I mean to detract any thing from the credit of the reporters, euen then when he scarse belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues that which is tould.</q> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="53">53. But could he (thinke you) haue sayd this for shame, if he had set downe <hi>S. Augustines</hi> wordes alleadged, and vrged by me, as before you haue seene? <hi>S. Augustin</hi> te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyeth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:15521:223"/> the apparition <hi>not vpon vncertaine ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> (as he himselfe sayth) <hi>but by the testimony of assured witnesses, confirmed also by the effects of benefits, no lesse then by the sight of men;</hi> and <hi>M. Collins</hi> maketh it doubtful, whether <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> belieued it or no; as if out of courtesy, and good manners only he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the credit of the reporters, though he scarce belieued it; for so <hi>M. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> insinuateth, though he do not affirme it directly of <hi>S. Augustin,</hi> but of many a man, which neuertheles he would haue you to suppose of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in this case; for els why doth he say it? May not this passe as well for a fraud, as for a miserable &amp; poore defēce of my Lord of <hi>VVinchesters</hi> bare <hi>heare-say?</hi> But let vs proceed to the rest of my Lords answer touching the manner of such apparitions, wherof I sayd thus, <hi>pag.</hi> 394. <hi>num.</hi> 43.</p>
            <p n="54">54. <q>Whereas <hi>M. Andrews</hi> addeth, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> was so vncertayne of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>apparitions,</hi> that he durst not define, whether they were made by the Saints themselues, or by Angels in their lykenes, he saith true, though I know not what he can inferre thereon for his purpose, seeing that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> maketh no question of the verity of apparitions (and much
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:15521:224"/> lesse of the benefit and help which deuout people receiued thereby) but only of the manner how the same was performed, &amp; therefore he saith in the beginning of that discourse, <hi>Ista quaestio &amp;c. This question surpasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th the force of my vnderstanding, how Martyrs do help those, quod per eos certum est adiuuari,</hi> who it is certayne are helped by them. So he. And then proceedeth with the question, whether the Martyrs are themselus present in so diuers places, and so far asunder at one tyme, or whether Almighty God do satisfie the deuotion of the people by the ministery of Angels, through the merits of the Martyrs, or els whether it be done both waies. This he saith he dare not defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, confessing and teaching euidently as much as we require in this matter, to wit that deuout people are certainly helped by the Martyrs. Neyther is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> would not take vpon him to determine how the same was wrought, saying that euen in ordinary and naturall things, the effects are euident and certayne, and yet the causes are many tymes eyther vncertayn, or els wholy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, which is to be graunted much more in supernaturall and miraculous euents, as I haue shewed euidently in the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:15521:224"/> last Chapter, where I haue confuted such another ridiculous argumēt of his against Prayer to Saints.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="55">55. <q>For albeit he had resolued, that the Saints themselues do not appeare or assist at their tombes, but Angels in their shape and lykenes; yet it could not be sayd but that apparition is theirs, being made by Gods expresse ordinance for their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in their name &amp; lykenes, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of those that expect &amp; craue their help; especially seeing it is vsually said in the holy Scriptures, that God spake &amp; appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Abrahā Gen.</hi> 18. &amp; <hi>Moyses Exod.</hi> 3. when neuertheles it was done by the ministry of Angels, and not in any shape that could represent him; and therfore <hi>S. Augustine</hi> had great reason to say, that <hi>S. Felix</hi> appeared, &amp; that the Martyrs <hi>per diuinam potentiam viuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum rebus intersunt,</hi> are by the diuine power present at the doings or affaires of men: although afterward he moueth a question concerning the manner of it, and doth not deny, but that it may be done by the ministery of Angels. Hereby then it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that this place of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> so clearely proueth the <hi>Apparition</hi> of Saints, &amp; that men are helped by their prayers and merits, that <hi>M. Andrews</hi> had no other way
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:15521:225"/> to shift it off handsomly, but to omit the wordes of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> as of small moment, &amp; testifying only a sleight matter o <hi>heare-say.</hi> Thus sayd I in my Adioynder.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="56">56 To all this M. <hi>Collins</hi> answereth thus <hi>pag.</hi> 384. <hi>lin.</hi> 15. But is not that pretty, number 44. <hi>that though the Saints appeare not in their own persons, yet the apparition may wel be called theyrs,</hi> viz. <hi>because Angells appeare for them in their name and likenes; as if the diuell did not counterfeit their name and likenes too, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he appearing, they may be sayd to appeare, as well, as when the Angells, by this reason.</hi> So he: wherein it is to be noted, first that he passeth ouer with silence all S. <hi>Augustines</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, without so much as mentioning it or him, to the end that he might seeme to impugne me only, and not him: secondly that which he setteth downe in a different letter, as my words (or at least as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance therof) is farre different from myne, which cannot by any meanes admit that diuellish example which he bringeth of the Diuell appearing in the name, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a Saint.</p>
            <p n="57">57. For the reason which I gaue, why the apparition of an Angell in the name, and likenes of a Saint, may be called the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of the Saint, had three grounds, to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:15521:225"/> wit, because it is made first by Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse ordinance, secondly, for the merits of the Saints, and thirdly for the benefit of those that expect, and craue his help; of which three respects or considerations, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, if God will ordaine, or permit it, in which case I graunt also that his apparitiō may be called the apparition of the Saint, as in the opinion of some (especially of the Heretickes of this tyme) <hi>Samuel</hi> is sayd in the Scripture 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 28. to haue appeared, when neuerthelesse they say the Diuell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his likenes; so as (according to their opinion) M. <hi>Collins</hi> his diuellish in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance maketh directly for me, and against him.</p>
            <p n="58">58. And therefore he goeth the more boldly forward striking stil at me by name
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:15521:226"/> (but lighting indeed vpon <hi>S. Augustine</hi>) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at one of those considerations of his, which before he omitted, and concealed, to wit, touching the <hi>Saints merits,</hi> whereof he sayth thus: <hi>yet ridiculously you add, that Angel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> appeare for the Saints merits, and so the Angells ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition is the Saints apparition.</hi> So he, making <hi>S. Aug.</hi> ridiculous (or to say truely himself ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) especially considering how he peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>S.

                  <hi>But first we haue tould you our mind about merits, in the former part of this book,</hi> which if any were in this life, yet none in the other, none in <hi>Patria</hi> where the saints are. They haue done meriting, and yet to merit for others is more abominable then for ones self.

            <p n="67">67. Also to proue that such appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions of Angells, may be called the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of the Saints, I added that the like manner of speach is vsuall in the holy Scripture, where it is said, that God spake and appeared to <hi>Abraham Gen.</hi> 18. and in <hi>Moyses Exodus</hi> 3. when neuerthelesse God himselfe did not speake, and appeare, but vsed therein the ministery of Angells, who spake, and appeared for him; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reas <hi>M.

So as that which I said before in the 14. number (to wit that the Angell which appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> was a created Angell) hangs very well togeather, with that which I say heer; for I signify in both places, that a crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="17">17. But for the better vnderstanding of <hi>Valentia,</hi> it is to be considered, that the great difference which he affirmeth to be betwixt the vertues of <hi>dulia</hi> and of religiō, consisteth in this, that <hi>dulia</hi> respecteth only
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:15521:240"/> the excellency of the Saint, resting therein without further relation to the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diuine excellency by me before mentioned; for so indeed, it is wholy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, and different from the vertue of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which doth not rest in any creature, but doth immediatly respect the honour due to God; but if we consider the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Saint, as not resting in him, but as hauing a further relation to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine excellency, which the Saint doth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate: so there is no need to distinguish the sayd honour from religion, euen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Valentia</hi> his grounds, who also is so farre from condemning the other opinion that he rather defendeth it against <hi>Caluin,</hi> to be no way derogatory to Gods glory, as it appeareth by that which M. <hi>Collins</hi> noteth very absurdly for a cōtradiction in <hi>Valentia,</hi> who sayth he seeth not how Gods honour is any way impayred (as <hi>Caluin</hi> sayth it is) <hi>if we giue one honour to God, and another to Saints, by one and the selfe same vertue of religion; for as, sayth he, we loue God, with the selfe same vertue of Charity, with the which we loue our Neighbour in his degree (without any iniury to the diuine Maiesty:) so also we may without any iniury to God, giue him his owne honour intierely, and to Saints theirs, eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Thus sayth <hi>Valentia;</hi> giuing to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that whereas there is a question amongst the Deuines, whether the honour that is giuen to God, and to his Saints, proceedeth from one, &amp; the selfe same ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Religion (as some hould it doth) or from two different vertues (which is <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> his opinion) there is no preiudice, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury done to Gods honour either way; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who hould it to be one, and the same vertue of religion, which giueth honour to both, do not conceaue that the honour giuen to the Saint resteth in him, but that it hath relation, &amp; passeth to that diuine excellency, which the Saint parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipateth, and is immediatly respected by religion; wheras <hi>Valentia,</hi> and those which hould, that they are two different vertues (whereby God, and his Saints are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) cōceaue the honour giuen to the saints to rest in a certaine degree of supernaturall excellency of the Saint, without further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the excellency of God, and that the vertue which giueth the sayd honour to the Saint respecteth his excellēcy <hi>proximè</hi> and <hi>elicitiuè;</hi> wheras the vertue of Religion respecteth it only <hi>imperatiuè</hi> and <hi>mediatè</hi> (as I haue signifyed before) that is to say, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="19">19. And heereby it appeareth, that there is no contradiction in <hi>Valentia</hi> either to himself (as <hi>M.

            <p n="20">20.

            <p n="21">21. Now then to come to the matter, you may remember, that I signifyed in the beginning of this Chapter, how my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> answereth a place alleaged by
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:15521:242"/> the Cardinall out of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> to <hi>Marcella,</hi> touching the <hi>adoration</hi> of the ashes of <hi>S. Iohn Baptist, Elizaeus,</hi> and <hi>Abdias,</hi> saying that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> doth not vse the word <hi>adoration</hi> in that place <hi>properly,</hi> but <hi>figuratiuely;</hi> wherof he giueth two reasons, the one, because <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> sayth also there that <hi>Marcella</hi> might <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerem lingere,</hi> licke the dust, <hi>Quare vt hoc, ita &amp; illud non propriè, sed figuratiuè,</hi> wherefore, as this, so also that, is not properly spoken, but figuratiuely. And albeit I confuted this at large, yet because the matter it selfe is not of much importance, I omit the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what <hi>M. Collins</hi> answereth therto, except only of one point wherin he giueth vs a tast of his great skill in Grammer, which also I thinke good to differre vntill I haue discouered his notable fraud in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering my reply to my Lords second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and by occasion thereof lay downe very important matter for the tryall of the truth in this Controuersy. Thus then I said in my Adioynder <hi>pag.</hi> 376. <hi>num.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="22">22. <q>His second reason why <hi>adorare</hi> is taken <hi>figuratiuely</hi> in that place of S. <hi>Hierome</hi> is this. <hi>Vbi verò,</hi> saith he, <hi>propriè ei loquendum erat &amp;c. For when S. Hierome was to speake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> to wit, to <hi>Vigilantius</hi> his aduersary (who pressed him strictly, and would

VVe do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and adore (I do not say) the Reliques of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, but neyther the Sunne nor the Moone, nor the Angells, nor the Cherubim, nor the Seraphim.</hi> Thus saith <hi>M.

            <p n="23">23. <q>
                  <hi>For thou shalt vnderstand good Reader, that S.</hi> Hierome <hi>heere speaketh (as the</hi> Logicians <hi>say,</hi> ad hominem, <hi>that is to say according to the sense and meaning of his aduersary</hi> Vigilantius (<hi>one of</hi> M.

<pb n="396" facs="tcp:15521:243"/>
                  <hi>alleageth.</hi> Ais, <hi>saith</hi> S. Hierome, Vigilantius &amp;c. You say, that Vigilantius (<hi>as we may say</hi> M. Andrews) openeth againe his stinking mouth, and casteth forth a most filthy sauour against the Reliques of holy Martyrs, and calleth vs, who reuerence them, and worship the bones of the dead, Cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarios, &amp; Idolatras, worshipers of Ashes, &amp; I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolators. So he. <hi>And in his tract. against</hi> Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius <hi>himself, he setteth downe</hi> Vigilantius <hi>his owne words thus:</hi> Quid necesse est &amp;c. VVhat need hast thou not only to honour with so great honour, but also to adore that (I knowe not what) which thou worshipest, carrying it in a litle vessell from place to place, and why doest thou kisse and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore dust lapt in a linnen cloth? <hi>And againe a litle after,</hi> VVe see you, according to the custome of the Gentils &amp;c. euery where kisse and adore I knowe not what little dust carried in a litle vessell, &amp; lapt in a precious linnen cloth. <hi>Thus wrote</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilantius.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. <q>Whereby you see how he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Catholicks of those daies with flat <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for worshipping, or adoring the <hi>Reliques</hi> of Saynts, taking adoration for worship due to God alone, in which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he calleth the Catholiks <hi>Idolators.</hi> And therefore <hi>S. Hierome</hi> answering him in the same sense, saith that which <hi>M. Andrews</hi> alleadgeth, to wit, <hi>Non adoramus reliquias
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:15521:243"/> Martyrum &amp;c. VVe do not adore the reliques of Martyrs</hi> (that is to say, we do not giue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine honor to the reliques of Martyrs, committing Idolatry as <hi>Vigilantius</hi> chargeth vs:) but, <hi>honoramus</hi> (saith he presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) <hi>reliquias Martyrum, vt eum cuius sunt Martyres adoremus &amp;c. VVe honor the Religues of Martyrs, that we may adore</hi> (or yield diuine honor to) <hi>him whose Martyres they are. Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus seruos &amp;c. VVe honour the seruants, to the end that their honor may redound to the honour of their Lord, who said, He which receiueth you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth me.</hi> Thus saith <hi>S.

Hierome</hi> denyeth the <hi>adoration</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques in the sense that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> obiected it, as we also doe (to wit as signifying a diuine honour) yet he approueth and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it in the sense of Catholiques, that is, as <hi>adoration</hi> signifieth a veneration and worship done to Saints, for the honour of God who is honoured and glorified thereby.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:15521:244"/>25. <q>To which purpose two things are to be noted in this matter, the one, that wheras <hi>Vigilantius</hi> chargeth the Catholicks to <hi>adore</hi> &amp; kisse euery where the <hi>Reliques</hi> of Martyrs, he shewed sufficiently, that the custome of the faithfull was at that tyme to do corporall reuerence thereto, not only by kissing them, but also by incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or bowing the body, which the word <hi>adoration</hi> signifieth, and <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p n="26">26. <q>The other is, that as <hi>Vigilantius</hi> did not herein reproue the particuler custome of some particuler men, but the pactice of whole Church at that tyme; so also <hi>S Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> did not impugne him only with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reasons and arguments of his owne, but also with publique examples, as of the publick translation of the holy <hi>Reliques</hi> of <hi>S.

Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> in the same sense, and with the same termes, and circumstances, that we Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks defend it at this day.

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:15521:246"/> fayth of the whole Church (from whence the publick, and vniuersall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise proceeded) and this appeareth by the examples which he alleadgeth of the most solemne, sumptuous, &amp; triumphant tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation of the holy reliques of <hi>S.

               </q> Thus saith <hi>M. Collins,</hi> with more which I will lay downe, when I shall haue said some what to this.</p>
            <p n="30">30. First, you see, that hitherto he doth not set downe so much as one word of my text (neither doth he afterward) &amp; the mention he maketh of it, is only this, that I brooke not, that <hi>S. Hieromes adorare cineres Abdiae</hi> should be expounded by <hi>S. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erome,</hi> himself (writing against <hi>Vigilantius</hi>) by <hi>non adoramus.</hi> But I wonder where he findeth, or how he gathereth of my text, that I do not brooke it, seeing that I had reason both to brooke it, and to be glad of it, as of that which turneth to <hi>M. Collins</hi> his confusion, and to the cleare <hi>proofe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick fayth, touching holy</hi> reliques. Secondly you see, he saith, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> wrote to <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> not <hi>paulò vigilantiùs perhaps,</hi> that is to say, not carefully and warily inough, wherby he cōtradicts not only my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> but also himself; for my Lord appealeth specialy to <hi>S.

               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:15521:247"/> written to <hi>Vigilantius</hi> to expound his <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus</hi> written to <hi>Marcella,</hi> saying, as you haue heard before, that when <hi>S.

               </hi> who pressed him strictly, then he denyeth the adoration of reliques with <hi>non adoramus,</hi> we do not adore them. So as my Lord presumeth that there <hi>S. Hierome</hi> wrote very warily, which also M. <hi>Collins</hi> himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth afterward expresly, saying thus of <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> writing first to <hi>Marcella,</hi> and after to <hi>Vigilantius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="31">31. <hi>In the full source</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torique, and when he spake without an Aduersary, or to one that could vnderstand him inoffensiuely, &amp; with discretiō sufficiēt, he speaks for adoring</hi> Abdias <hi>his ashes, that is, for the zealous resorting to the place of his buriall (for that is all:) but where he speakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Aduersary, before</hi> Vigilātius, <hi>like the Bird which sleeps with the throne at her breast, then more vigilantly, more accurately, and more circumspecth he denyes it vtterly, that they adore either reliques, or things better then relikes, euen those for whose sake the reliques are made much off.</hi> So he: affirming expresly that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> to <hi>Vigilantius</hi> wrote <hi>more vigilantly, more accurately, and more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly,</hi> wheras before he sayd, that he wrot to him <hi>perhaps not paulò vigilantiùs,</hi> not vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, or warily inough: and though

            <p n="32">32. But then he goeth forward, and alleadgeth some part of <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> Text thus. There, <hi>error iuuenum,</hi> and <hi>culpa muliercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum non est imputanda religiosis hominibus; the errour of young men, and the default of light giddy women is not to be imputed to religious persons. There</hi> paucorum culpa non praeiudicat religioni, <hi>the aberration of some few is no preiudice to religion. Lastly there,</hi> non adoramus &amp;c. <hi>VVe worship nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reliques, nor Martyrs, nor Angells, neither any name that is named either in this world, or in the world to come, but God only.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>M. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins,</hi> seeking notably to cosen, and gull the vnwary Reader and to make him belieue, that S. <hi>Hierome</hi> not only renounceth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Reliques with his <hi>non adoaramus</hi> but also that he attributeth the same as a fault to a few young men and light giddy headed women, whose errour should not be imputed to religious persons, or to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it selfe; wherein truly I cannot but admire, and detest the impudent falsity of this fellow.</p>
            <p n="33">33. For he not only vseth the same fraud that my Lord of <hi>VVinchester</hi> did in the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:15521:248"/> fraudulent, and lame allegation of <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>romes</hi> text, leauing out that which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and clearely proueth the veneration of Reliques (as you haue seene in that which I haue alleadged out of my Adioynder) but also he craftily dissembleth what the fault was, which Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> blameth in these young men, and light giddy-headed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to the end his Reader may conceaue it to be the veneration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f Reliques; wheras the fault was that some delicts of inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency were committed by yong men, and women in Churches in the night, whyles they watched at the tombes of Martyrs (as then the custome was) which custome <hi>Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantius</hi> impugned vpon pretence of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, and <hi>S.

            <p n="34">34. And this also would haue beene cleare inough, if M. <hi>Collins</hi> had not curtalled <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> Text in two or three places, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in those few lines which he alleadgeth out of him. For <hi>S.

            <p n="35">
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:15521:249"/>35. And can there be a fyner piece of cozenage then this? But all this whyle, you see nothing answered to all that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple discourse which I made in my Adioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of <hi>S.

Hierom</hi> (that is to say yeild diuine honour to) <hi>him, whose Martyrs they are: we honour the seruants, sayth he, that their honour may redound to the honour of their Lord.</hi> Nothing is sayd to the publik practise of the Church expresly testifyed by <hi>S.

To all this, I

            <p n="36">36.

And it is no marueile, though he laboureth not to cleare my Lord of that cryme, seeing he falleth into it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, alleadging the same wordes that my Lord did, with the same fraud, as if I had not discouered it in my Lord, and charged his Lordship directly with it. Can there be greater falsity, &amp; impudency then this?</p>
            <p n="37">37. Neuertheles, that you may see, how narrowly he hath pryed into my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vpon <hi>S.

            <p n="38">38. For whereas my Lord had obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to me <hi>S. Hieromes non adoramus &amp;c.</hi> and I had signifyed in my Adioynder, that <hi>S.

<pb n="411" facs="tcp:15521:250"/> did) he could not but see the errour to be in the print, and not in my translation, which is very litterall, according to the true wordes and text of <hi>S.

Collins</hi> sheweth himselfe no lesse impertinēt then malicious to take exception to my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinity for this; but of his translations, and latinity, I shall haue occasion to speake els where, and make no doubt to proue him to be most ridiculous for both.</p>
            <p n="40">40. But that which I wish to be noted heere is, that his diligence to search out, &amp; to take hould of such trifles as this doth cōdemne him of willfull malice in balking such an euident testimony of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like truth as heer he saw, and dissembleth, <hi>excolans culicem, &amp; camelum glutiens</hi> (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:15521:251"/> sayd of the Pharisees <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.) <hi>stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Gnat, and swallowing vp a Camel.</hi> For in this very place which he calleth in question for my translation, he saw three things, which sufficed to confound both my Lord and him. The first, that he and his fellows (who charge vs with Idolatry for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of holy Reliques) are the true brood of <hi>Vigilantius</hi> the Heretike. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that as often, as they inueigh against holy Reliques, they open their stinking mouths, &amp; cast forth a filthy sauour in the opinion of <hi>S. Hierome.</hi> The third, that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> meant by his, <hi>non adoramus reliquias Martyrum,</hi> only to cleare the Catholikes of that tyme of the imputation of Idolatry; &amp; therefore he denyeth that the Catholikes did adore them with diuine honour, but denyeth not the worship and veneration, which the Church vseth, and he expresly acknowledgeth presently after, as I haue amply declared before, &amp; M. <hi>Collins</hi> himself confesseth it a little after in the same Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph though very absurdly saying thus: S. <hi>Hierome expounds his adorare, in one place by non adorare, sed honorare in another; when the passion was cooled, &amp; the iudgment awaked. Non colimus &amp; adoramus, sed honoramus &amp;c. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cont. Vigil.</hi> Thus sayth he. Giuing to vnderstand, that
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:15521:251"/> when <hi>S. Hierome</hi> wrote to <hi>Marcella,</hi> and vsed the word <hi>adorare,</hi> he was in heat of passion, and his iudgment was a sleep; but when he wrote against <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> his passion was cooled, and his iudgment awaked, &amp; that therefore he tempered it with a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate word, to wit, <hi>honorare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">41 Heereupon it may be gathered, that in the opinion of <hi>M. Collins, S. Hierome</hi> being in the heate of his passion, when he wrote to <hi>Marcella,</hi> vsed <hi>adorare</hi> to signify di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine worship; and so when he inuited her to <hi>adore</hi> the ashes of <hi>S. Iohn Baptist, Elizaeus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Abdias,</hi> he would haue her to commit flat Idolatry; els why was he more in passion, when he wrote to her, then when he wrot against <hi>Vigilantius?</hi> For if he vnderstood no more by <hi>adorare,</hi> writing to <hi>Marcella,</hi> but <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norare</hi> (as M. <hi>Collins</hi> sayth he expounds it in his booke against <hi>Vigilantius</hi>) wherein did then consist the heat of his passion? Perhaps <hi>M. Collins</hi> wil say, that it consisted in that he applyed <hi>adorare</hi> to creatures, which is due only to the Creatour, but if he say so, what will he say of <hi>S. Ambrose, S. Augustine,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers, yea and of the penners of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures themselues, who apply it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often to the worship of creatures, as I haue amply shewed in my Adioynder.</p>

            <p n="43">43. Now then, I would gladly know of M. <hi>Collins,</hi> why <hi>S.

<pb n="415" facs="tcp:15521:252"/> then they were as much ouerseene as <hi>S.

Hierome</hi> had as good a warrant to vse it in that sense as any other; so as M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath shewed himselfe no lesse simple then saucy, to censure so deeply this learned, and holy Father for vsing a word in a sense no lesse frequent in holy Scripture, then in the ancient Fathers.</p>
            <p n="44">44. Much more modestly (though absurdly) did my Lord answere this place of <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> saying that he vsed <hi>adorare</hi> (not <hi>properly</hi> but) <hi>figuratiuely,</hi> and namely by the figure called <hi>Catachresis,</hi> which I confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amply in my Adioynder, by the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Quintilian,</hi> and <hi>Isidore,</hi> who teach that <hi>Catachresis</hi> doth import the abuse of a <hi>metaphore,</hi> when there wanteth a proper word, which cannot be sayd in this case; for <hi>honorare</hi> and <hi>venerari</hi> might haue expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>S.

            <p n="45">45. And now to the end you may see what a good <hi>Gramarian M. Collins</hi> is, who often carpeth at my little skill it grammer (though hitherto little to his credit) you shall

               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:15521:255"/> insinuated in the 23.

            <p n="2">2. His second place of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his second booke of Offices <hi>cap.</hi> 28. where he sayth thus: <hi>Nemo potest indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, quia humandis fidelium reliquijs spatia laxata sunt: nemo potest dolere, quia in sepulturis Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum requies desunctorum est. No man can grudge that the ground should be enlarged for the buriall of the bodyes of the faythfull deceased: no man can be sorry, that the rest or repose of the dead is in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall or graues of the Christians.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Ambrose:</hi> whereupon M. <hi>Collins</hi> asketh this
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:15521:256"/> question. Is this man likely, sayth he, to countenance Reliques or the worshipping thereof? Yes truely <hi>M. Collins,</hi> the man is so likely to do it, and doth it indeed so fully (which you shall see after a whyle) that you may be ashamed to demand this, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vpon no better ground then vpon this place heere alleadged, which might indeed proue somewhat against such as would deny that Christians ought to be buryed, or affirme, that is it not a worke of mercy to bury the dead, and to prouide Church-yards, or conuenient places for it: but against the worshipping, or preseruing of the Reliques of Martyrs or Saints, <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> in this place sayth nothing at all, for that he speaketh not of such dead men, but only of the dead bodyes of ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, amongst whome very many dye without all opinion of sanctity, and many with doubt whether they be saued or no, &amp; many others, though in respect of their knowne vertue they may haue a great opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of holynesse, yet because the Church hath not giuen any publique approbation thereof, eyther by their Canonization, or otherwayes, they are not reputed, nor ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked among the Saints whose Reliques are are reserued or honoured, but amongst the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:15521:256"/> rest of the faythfull deceased; whereas the knowne, and canonized Saints are not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned amongst the dead, but amongst the euerliuing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For this cause the Church doth ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the feasts of the Martyrs, &amp; Saints with the title of <hi>Natalis,</hi> or <hi>Natalitium,</hi> their birth day, although it be indeed the day of their Martyrdome, or death, as it is euident not only in the publique office, &amp; seruice of the Church, but also in the Homilyes, and Sermons of the ancient Fathers made in the sayd feasts, and therfore (to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> (of whome we now spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially treate) beginneth his Sermon in the feast of the Apostles S. <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Paul</hi> thus: <hi>Natalem beatissimorum Apostolorum Petri &amp; Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li hodie celebramus &amp;c.</hi> This day we celebrate the birth-day of the most blessed Apostles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The like he sayth of the feasts of the Saints <hi>Cantius</hi> and <hi>Cantionilla,</hi> and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Whereof he yeildeth the reason, in his foresayd Sermon of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul</hi> saying: <hi>Non enim mortui sunt</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For they are not dead, whose birth we celebrate this day, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne againe, they liue with bread, because they are made partakers of Christ, who is the bread of life to all; for although their bodyes were slaine by their
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:15521:257"/> passion (or suffering) yet the order of the liuing is not interrupted thereby; therefore it is not to be called a death, by the meanes whereof we are free from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutours, and vnited with Christ for euer &amp;c.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Amboose,</hi> whereby <hi>M. Collins</hi> may see, that when he speaketh in generall tearmes of the buryalls, and graues, or of the bodyes of the dead, he doth not cōpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the sacred Tombes, shrynes, or holy bodyes, and reliques of the euerliuing mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and Saints of God, whose neuer-dying memoryes the Church doth celebrate.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And therefore now to answere to his question propounded before (as you haue heard) whether this man (he meaneth <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>) was likely to countenance Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, or the worshipping thereof? I must needs say, that if he be not ignorant aboue measure, he cannot be excused from exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant malice, in making a question of that whereof no man can doubt that is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> or <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and much lesse a Doctor, &amp; publique Reader of Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for who knoweth not, if he haue read eyther of those Fathers, that <hi>S.

Geruasius</hi> and <hi>Protasius,</hi> SS. <hi>Nazarius</hi> &amp; <hi>Celsus,</hi>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:15521:257"/> SS. <hi>Vitalis</hi> &amp; <hi>Agricola,</hi> were at three seuerall tymes found out by <hi>S.

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:15521:258"/> reliques, notwithstanding that <hi>M.

            <p n="8">8. But will you see what <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> sayth further concerning those holy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s in his Sermon made to the people at the finding thereof? This may be seene in his Epistle 54. to his Sister <hi>Marcellina,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declareth, that he tould the people (&amp; for the proofe of it, appealed to their owne knowledge &amp; eye-sight) that Diuels were expelled out of many possessed persōs, that many diseased were cured of their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, that some were healed with a certaine shaddowe of the holy Bodyes; that the handkercheifes, and garments, which were cast vpon the most sacred reliques became <hi>tactu ipso medicabilia,</hi> medicinall euen by tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them, and that therfore all men were desirous, and glad to touch them, <hi>&amp; qui con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigerit, saluus erit,</hi> and he that shal touch them shalbe safe or cured. Thus doth <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> testify, what great benefits Almighty God bestowed vpon those, that honoured his Saints, and their reliques, or rather him in them.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:15521:259"/>9. And so farre was S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> from desiring that the holy reliques of those Saints should be hid againe, and buryed in obliuion (after they were found) that he distributed som parts of thē to his friends farre and neere, whereby many Churches were built in honour of them, not only in <hi>Rome,</hi> and diuers places of <hi>Italy,</hi> but also in <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Africke,</hi> as may be seene in <hi>Baronius Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>Ann. an.</hi> 387. And now to shew further how much <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and honoured holy Reliques, and for what reason, I will lay downe his owne wordes in his 14. sermon of the two holy Martyrs <hi>SS. Nazarius</hi> &amp; <hi>Celsus,</hi> where spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the great worthines of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, he sayth thus.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Quod si dicas mihi quid honores &amp;c.</hi>
               <q>If you say vnto me what doest thou honour in flesh now already dissolued and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wherof God hath no care, then wher is that, my dearely beloued, which truth it selfe spake by the Prophet: <hi>pretiosa in conspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu Domini mors Sanctorum eius,</hi> the death of Gods Saints is pretious in his sight? And againe: <hi>mihi autem nimis honorificandi sunt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici tui Deus.</hi> O God, thy friends are to be honoured of me exceeding much. We ought to honour Gods seruants of whome it is
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:15521:259"/> sayd in another place, <hi>Dominus custodit omnia ossa eorum, &amp; vnum ex his non conteretur:</hi> our Lord preserueth all their bones, and one of them shall not be consumed, or perish. I honour therefore in the Martyrs flesh the scarrs or marks of the wounds receaued for the name of Christ. I honour the memory of him that liueth with the perpetuity of Vertue. I honour the ashes that are conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated by the confession of the name of Christ. I honour that body, which hath shewed me how to loue my Lord, &amp; hath taught me not to feare death for his sake. And why shold not the faythful honor that body which the Diuells do also reuerence; and albeit they afflicted it in punishing it; yet they do now glorify it in the sepulcher. Therefore I honour that body which Christ hath honoured by the sword, and which shall raigne with Christ in heauen.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Thus farre I haue thought good to lay downe <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> his owne words, to perswade <hi>M. Collins,</hi> if it may be, that this man (as he calleth him) is not ōly <hi>likly to coū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance reliques, and the worshipping of them,</hi> but that he also performed it indeed, yea and with great reason, as you haue seene by this his owne pious, &amp; very elegant discourse: how then can <hi>M. Collins</hi> read this without
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:15521:260"/> blushing? Or henceforth looke any man in face, who he may thinke hath read it, &amp; seene withall what he hath written heere; seeing that it is euident heereby, and by the premisses, that he maketh no cōscience or scruple at all to delude, and deceaue his Reader, with a vaine shew, and ostentatiō of the authority of Fathers, when they are flatly against him, as heere you see, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth against holy Reliques some pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, pieces, and scraps, as I may say, of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> nothing at all to the purpose, whē neuerthelesse he knoweth in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciēce, that the sayd holy Father doth both in deedes and doctrine, vtterly condemne him; besides that I may note heer the same fraud that he vsed in the former place, to wit, his changing the state of the question from Saints to ordinary dead men, which are of farre different condition, and doe therefore require, and admit farre different considerations.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And now albeit I hast to make an end, &amp; am looth to detaine my selfe vpon trifles, yet I cannot omit to say somewhat to a <hi>parenthesis</hi> of his, in the allegation of the aforesayd place of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> to wit: <hi>Nemo potest indignari humādis fidelium reliquijs, spatia esse laxata,</hi> which he translateth thus: <hi>It is no
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:15521:260"/> fault, nor thing to be grudged at (vnlesse then by the Arians, who carpt at</hi> S. Ambrose <hi>without cause, and so now by the Iesuits) that the ground is enlarged to bury the remnāts of the faithful bodyes massacred.</hi> So he, giuing to vnderstand, by his <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> that the Iesuits carpe at <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> now without cause, as the Arians did then; but wherein trow you, do the Iesuits now, or euer carpe at S. <hi>Ambrose?</hi> truly I thinke that no man but <hi>M. Collins</hi> euer hard, or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned any such matter.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Arians carped at him (as he signifieth himselfe in his 2. booke of offices <hi>cap.</hi> 28.) not because he enlarged Church yardes, but because he brake the Chalices, and siluer vessels of the Church for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Captiues, by the occasion whereof he giueth 3. instances, when, &amp; in what cases the sacred vessells of the Church may be alienated; to wit, for the redemption of Captiues, for the releife of the poore, and for the enlarging of places to bury the dead when need requireth it. But I hope <hi>M. Collins</hi> will not be so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to say, that the <hi>Iesuits</hi> euer carped at <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> for any of those things; then let him tell vs for what els, which I am sure he shall neuer be able to do; and therefore you see, how idly he tatleth, eyther not
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:15521:261"/> knowing, or not caring, what he saith▪ so that he say some what to make vp his muck-heape of absurdityes, fraudes, and fooleryes, and by the way to spit out now and then some part of his spite against the Iesuits.</p>
            <p n="14">14. But now let vs proceed: he goeth forward in the same veyne, adding exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to the authorityes of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that the translation and circumgestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reliques is alltogeather vnlawfull. His first is out of <hi>Sozomen. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. where speaking of an intent that <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> had to remoue the body of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, out of a Church in <hi>Constantinople</hi> (where it was first interred) he sayth that the Orthodoxe, &amp; godly Christians opposed thēselues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, houlding it <hi>sor no lesse a sacriledge to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late dead bodyes, then to breake open tombes violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly or feloniously:</hi> whereupon <hi>M. Collins</hi> sayth. <hi>And do not these (Orthodoxe Christians) cōdemne the vse of Reliques, which in you is accompanyed with translation, with circumgestation, and such like pompes?</hi> So he, as well to the purpose, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he alleadged the two places of S. <hi>Ambrose;</hi> for heere he changeth the state of the question, no lesse then there, from a matter of religion, to a meere ciuill mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:15521:261"/>15. This wilbe euydent by the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the history, concealed by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> though they be set downe by <hi>Sozomen</hi> himselfe, whom he citeth. Thus then it passed. <hi>Macedonius</hi> the hereticall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> beying resolued to translate the body of <hi>Constantyne</hi> the great, from the Church where it was buryed (because he thought it was lyke to fall) was resisted by the people, who neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les were deuided in opinion concerning the same; for some of them held it for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyety to translate the body, no lesse then if it should be digged vp agayn; and others thought it not to be a matter of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because (as <hi>Socrates</hi> saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 30.) it seemed to them, that a dead body could receiue no hurt thereby. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks also (saith the history) resisted with common consent, because they held it for an iniury, and dishonour to the Emperour <hi>Constantyne,</hi> who had been of their Comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is to say a Catholike, as they were, besides other Considerations, which shalbe declared after a while. Neuerthelesse <hi>Macedonius</hi> remoued the body, though with great bloud-shed, and slaughter of people, that resisted him; wherevpon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Constantius</hi> (who before fauoured <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius</hi>
               <pb n="434" facs="tcp:15521:262"/> very much) was much alienated from him, for the outrage committed in the slaughter of so many, slayn by that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and for the dishonour, and iniury done to his Father; and lastly because it was done without his consent. This is the substance of the history, wherein you see, there is nothing at all that maketh against the translation of Saints bodyes.</p>
            <p n="16">16. First, because the motiue which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Macedonius</hi> to translate <hi>Constantynes</hi> body, was not any respect of holynes therin, or to honor God in his seruants, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religious consideration, but for a meer ciuill, or temporal respect, to wit, because the Church wherin he was buryed, was (as it seemed to <hi>Macedonius</hi>) in danger to fal, albeit there was no such present danger, as experience shewed, for the Church stood still on foot, and was repayred a hundred yeares after by <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Seconly, the motyues, which moued the Catholiks to resist the transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might be diuers, whereof one might well be, that they saw no such danger that the Church would full as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonius</hi> pretended; another cause vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly was, the great auersion that they had frō the wicked heretik <hi>Macedonius</hi> their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:15521:262"/> enemy &amp; persecutor, in which respect they were easily induced to adhere to those that withstood him in that action; and the third motiue is declared in the history, to wyt, because they held it for a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury to the worthy Emperour deceased.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Hereof two reasons may be yeilded, the one because <hi>Macedonius</hi> being a pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons heretik, was not of <hi>Constantines</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but sought by that translation of his body, to perswade the world that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> was of his sect, which no doubt was most iniurious, not only to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that Catholike Emperour, but also to all Catholicks who were of his Communion; the other reason was becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se <hi>Constantyne</hi> had built that Church most sumptuosly in honour of all the Apostles, with intention to be buryed there, to which end, he caused also some of the Apostles reliques to be brought thither, as <hi>Socrates</hi> witnesseth <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof he yeildeth this reason (which I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>(saith Socrates) and other Emperours his successors should be destituted of the Apostles reliques:</hi> therfor I say, the Catholicks had great reason to take it for an indignity, and great iniury to that pious Emperour, that his body
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:15521:263"/> should be remoued by an heretike, from such a famous Church built by himselfe for his own buriall, in honour of the Apostles, and enriched with their reliques, to a Church of far lesse note, as that was, whither <hi>Macedonius</hi> translated it, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated only to S. <hi>Acacius</hi> the martyr.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Furthermore, if <hi>Macedonius</hi> had me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to haue translated the body of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> in quality of a Saints body, with such religious deuotion, and solemnity as is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall, and requisite in such translations: neyther the Catholicks, nor yet <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour eyther would or could haue taken it for an iniury to <hi>Constantine,</hi> who should haue receaued more true honour thereby, then euer he did by his triumphs, or trophyes, or any other secular honour that was euer done vnto him, whiles he liued; so as you see, this case of the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual of <hi>Constantines</hi> body, for meer temporall respects, is far different from ours, which admitteth only religious Consideraions, aswell for the motyues, as for the manner and execution of it, all to be intended, &amp; performed with reuerence, and deuotion to the greater honour of God, and his Saints. And therefore <hi>M. Collins</hi> still shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth wyde of the marke, and is here aswell beside
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:15521:263"/> the Cushion, as beside the question; let vs then see how he goeth on, which I beseech thee (good reader) well to note, and thou shalt see him play his part kindly, I meane of a notable cozening, and cogging Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyon.</p>
            <p n="20">20. <q>Thus then he sayth. When <hi>Babylas</hi> his body was translated from <hi>Daphne</hi> to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> by <hi>Iulians</hi> appointment, and the Diuels instigatiō (not by any seeking of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people) they cryed that accompanyed it all the way as they went: <hi>confundātur omnes qui adorant sculptilia;</hi> confounded be all they that worship carued images. Doth this please you?</q> Thus sayth he. To whom I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that truly it doth both please me, &amp; displease me: it pleaseth me, and that very much, that this example of the translation of <hi>S. Babylas</hi> being truly related, will nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confirme the translation and venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holy reliques, wherby <hi>M.

            <p n="21">21. Three thinges you see he seemeth to vrge against vs in this example: the first that <hi>S. Babylas</hi> his body was translated by the appoyntment of <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata;</hi> the second, that it was done by the Diuels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation (and not by any seeking of the Christians;) the third, that they which did accompany it, cryed all the way as they went, <hi>Confounded be all they that worship carued Images.</hi> By the two first he would haue his Reader to conceaue, that the good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of those dayes, did not seeke to translate the bodyrs of Saints, but that the Diuell suggested it, &amp; <hi>Iuliā</hi> the wicked <hi>Apostata</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d it to be performed; &amp; by the third he thinketh that he hath giuen a great blow to our worshipping of holy Images.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Now then to discouer his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous falshood in these three points, it is to be vnderstood, that this <hi>S. Babylas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very holy man, and Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> was martyred in the time of <hi>Decius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:15521:264"/> and that being buryed in that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his body was held in great veneration there amongst the Christians, vntill the tyme of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperour, when <hi>Gallus</hi> his sisters Sonne, and brother to <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> being declared Caesar, and Gouernour of all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ast parts, translated it into <hi>Daphne</hi> neere vnto <hi>Antioch,</hi> vpon this occasion.</p>
            <p n="23">23. There had beene in <hi>Daphne</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tyme a famous temple, and Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> whereto there was continually great confluence of people, especially of yong men and women, in respect of the pleasant scituation of the place, which gaue occasiō at the first to the Poeticall fable, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phne</hi> was there turned into a Bay-tree, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from <hi>Apollo,</hi> who was enamoured of her; for which cause also the superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pagans thought that <hi>Apollo</hi> made speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all choice of that place for his Temple, and Oracle, by the which the Diuell deluded the people for many ages; and for as much as that place, was as it were a nursery, not only of abominable superstitiōs (by reason of the Oracle) but also of all intemperance, incontinence, and ryot (by reason of the deliciousnes of the place) <hi>Gallus</hi> being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Christian, &amp; a pious Prince built
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:15521:265"/> a Church there for the Christians, and translated thither the holy reliques of <hi>S.

               <hi>Deo ipsius animum ad id impellente</hi> (sayth <hi>S. Chrysostome lib. contra Gentiles</hi>) God mouing his mind therto, for the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Diuell, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red euidently by the euent, which was this.</p>
            <p n="24">24. The holy body was no sooner placed in <hi>Daphne,</hi> but it strocke the Diuell dumbe, which not only <hi>Theodoret</hi> (whome M. <hi>Collins</hi> alleadgeth in his margent, and seemeth to follow for this story) but also al other Historiographers doe affirme with vnanime consent, yea and <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> who liued at the same tyme, doth testify in his sayd booke against the Gentils, in these
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:15521:265"/> words: <hi>Illi os ita obstruxit, vt vel lapidibus ipsis magis mutus redderetur;</hi> he (to wit, <hi>S. Babylas</hi>) did so stop the Diuells mouth, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more dumbe then the very stones: &amp; then after a few words he addeth: <hi>He which was wont to deceaue all men euery where, could not endure to see the very ashes of</hi> Babylas <hi>being dead,</hi> Ea enim est Sanctorum potestas &amp;c. <hi>for such is the power of Saints, that Diuells cannot endure their shaddowes, or cloathes whyles they liue, and do feare their Tombes when they are dead; therfore if there be any man that doth not belieue those things which are sayd to haue beene done by the Apostles, let him but consider the miracles done at this memory</hi> (that is to say, at the Reliques of this holy Martyr) <hi>and let him be no longer impudent; for he which in tymes past did triumph ouer all the Gentills being now rebuked</hi> (or checked) <hi>by the Martyr, as by his maister, was silent, and barked no more.</hi> Thus sayth S. <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> Now doth this please you <hi>M. Collins?</hi> Do you like it that God moued <hi>Gallus</hi> to translate these Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, and that they were of such force to strike the Diuell dumbe? Doth it please you, that the Diuell, and you are proued heere to be of one humour, seeing that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of you both can abide holy Reliques? But let vs heare the rest.</p>
            <p n="25">25. After this both <hi>Gallus</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:15521:266"/> being dead, and <hi>Iulian</hi> the wicked <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stata</hi> in possession of the whole Empire, it chaunced, that he being determined to make warre against the <hi>Persians,</hi> came to <hi>Daphne</hi> to consult with his God <hi>Apollo,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the issue and successe of the warre, but hauing giuen many Donatiues, and multiplyed sacrifice vpō sacrifice, he could get no other answere, but that there were many dead bodyes there about; which must be remoued before he could answere him, this was presently vnderstood as well by <hi>Iulian</hi> himselfe, as by <hi>Apolloes</hi> Priests, that it concerned only the body of <hi>S. Babylas;</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ereupon he gaue present order, that the <hi>Galileans</hi> (for so he called the Christians) shold remoue his body to some other place whither they would, which being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, a great multitude of men, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ould and young flocked thither from <hi>Antioch,</hi> &amp; placing the holy body in a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, carryed and accompanyed it to <hi>Antioch</hi> with exceeding great ioy and exultation, leaping, dancing, and singing of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> &amp; often repeating this verse: <hi>Consundantur omnes qui adorant sculptilia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded be they which adore grauen Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, meaning <hi>Iulian</hi> and his Paynims, who committed Idolatry to the Statua, or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:15521:266"/> of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and other false Gods, adoring them with diuine honour.</p>
            <p n="26">26. And that this only was their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it is euident by all the Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, &amp; therfore <hi>Theodoret</hi> (whom <hi>M. Collins</hi> citeth) hauing sayd that the people conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually repeated that verse, addeth: <hi>Nam Martyris translatione Diabolū victum existimarunt,</hi> for they thought that the Diuel was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the translation of the Martyrs. <hi>Socrates</hi> sayth <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. that, <hi>Psalmi quos cecinere, reprehensionem Deorum Gentilium, &amp; eorum qui in idola credebant, complexi sunt,</hi> the psalmes which they song did conteyne the reprehension of the Gods of the Gentils, &amp; of those who belieued in Idols. <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> who liued at the same time, witnesseth the same <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 35. saying that all the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> did sing that verse <hi>in auribus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phani Principis,</hi> in the eares of that prophane Prince, for six miles togeather, with such exultation that the heauens did ring with the noyse, and that <hi>Iulian</hi> was so extreamly offended therwith, that he caused many of the Christians to be apprehended, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, and tormented.</p>
            <p n="27">27. And amongst the rest, there was one <hi>Theodorus</hi> a young man, who being found to be one of the ring-leaders of that
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:15521:267"/> holy, and deuout dance, was tormented a whole forenoone, with so great cruelty, and variety of tormentes, that <hi>Nulla aetas</hi> (sayth <hi>Ruffinus ibid. cap.</hi> 36.) <hi>simile factum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minerit,</hi> no age hath made mention of the like. Neuertheles God did so miraculously preserue, &amp; assist him in his torments, that he continually song most cheerefully the same verse, which he song the day before, wherewith the tormentors were so astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that they set him free; and afterwards he tould <hi>Ruffinus</hi> and others, that he was all the while conforted by a yong man, who stood by him continually, and wyped the sweat from him with a towell, and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed him with cold water, which seemed so delectable vnto him, that he was sorry when he was loosed from the Racke. And thus did Almighty God approue al the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that was don to his Martyrs reliques by a most manifest miracle, testifyed by as many as write this story.</p>
            <p n="28">28. By all this then it appeareth: first that the Emperour <hi>Gallus</hi> translated the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reliques of this holy <hi>Martyr Babylas</hi> from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Daphne, Deo,</hi> sayth <hi>S. Chrysostome, ad id animum ipsius impellente,</hi> God mouing his mind vnto it. Wherby <hi>M. Collins</hi> may see that it is no diuellish, or euill worke to
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:15521:267"/> trāslate reliques, as he would haue his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der suppose.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Secondly that the Diuell incited <hi>Iulian</hi> to remoue again those holy Reliques to his own confusion, because he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged thereby, that he was vanquished by them: whereby <hi>M. Collins</hi> may also see, how true it is which <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> sayth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Diuells feare the shaddow of a Saint whiles he liueth, and his ashes when he is dead.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Thirdly, that the verse of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, which the people song, to wit, <hi>Confun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantur omnes qui adorant sculptilia,</hi> did no way concerne the worship, and veneration of holy Images, but the adoration of Idols, to the confusion, not only of <hi>Iulian,</hi> and the Gentills, but also of the Diuell, and M. <hi>Collins:</hi> for as that verse triumphantly song in the translation of the Martyrs Reliques did then confound the Diuell, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments (<hi>Iulian,</hi> and the Gentills;) so also the history of it alleadged by <hi>M. Collins,</hi> doth now confound the Diuell and him, who by the Diuels instigation, is no lesse enemy to holy Reliques, then <hi>Iulian,</hi> and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tills were.</p>
            <p n="31">31. Fourthly, that Almighty God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed euidently by the miraculous constancy
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:15521:268"/> and patience of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> that all this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done to the holy Martyr, and to his Reliques in the translation of them, was most gratefull to his diuin Maiesty, &amp; that therefore it is most true, which you haue heard before out of <hi>S. Hierome, Honor seruo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum redundat ad Dominum,</hi> the honour done to the seruants redoundeth to their Lord.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Lastly, it appeareth that M. <hi>Collins</hi> hath most shamefully abused, and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this history, vrging it so mangled and maymed, as you haue seene against the trā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, and worship of Reliques; whereas being wholy, and truly related, it doth notably confirme the same. Iudg then good Reader, what consciene, and honesty there is in this man.</p>
            <p n="33">33. And that the same may yet more manifestly appeare, I cannot omit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue by the way, how he seeketh to delude his Reader with the quotation of <hi>S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> for this history of <hi>S. Babylas,</hi> as if that holy Father had applyed it, as he (I meane <hi>M. Collins</hi>) doth against the vse of translatiō or veneration of holy Reliques; whereas he r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>counteth it purposely to shew the wonderfull vertue, and power of Gods Saints, and their Reliques, to proue therby that Christ (whose seruants they are) is
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:15521:268"/> God; so as <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> is so farre from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying and impugning the vertue of holy Reliques, that he maketh the same to be an argument of Christs diuinity; besides that he also giueth so cleare, and ample testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny elswhere, of the spiritual benefits which the faythfull, &amp; deuout Christians receaue by holy Reliques, that I thinke good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late some part of it heer, vpon this occasiō.</p>
            <p n="34">34. In his sermon vpon the feast of <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> (wherin he treateth of the solemne translation of his body from <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was martyred, to <hi>Antioch</hi> whereof he had beene Bishop) he sayth thus: All the Cittyes <hi>(sayth he)</hi> in the way receauing the Saint,<note place="margin">

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:15521:269"/> alacrity, and comfort; <q>and therefore wee do repayre vnto him not only now, but also euery day, receiuing of him spirituall benefit; for whosoeuer cometh to him with fayth, is benefitted exceedingly;</q> for not only the bodyes of Saints,<note place="margin">

               <hi>when the grace of God is more aboundant, and the force of the spirit greater: so as if any do touch but the tombe, or coffin, he may receaue therby great vertue; and therefore God hath graunted vs the vse of the Reliques of Saints, that he may bring vs to him by the imitation of them, &amp; that they may be to vs, as it were, a certaine hauen and a conuenient comfort of those euills, which doe continually afflict vs. VVherfore I exhort you all (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) if any of you be pressed with any grief of mind or sicknes of body, or other calamity, that he come
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:15521:269"/> hither with fayth</hi> (or confidence) <hi>wherby he may be freed from the same and returne with great Ioy, yea and by the very sight thereof, he may haue his conscience more peacable, and quyet.</hi> So sayth this holy and auncient Father.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Doth this please you <hi>M. Collins?</hi> Is this man (as you said to me ere whyle of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>) like to countenance and patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyze you in impugning holy reliques? and here it is also to be noted, that this solemne translation of <hi>S. Ignatius,</hi> which <hi>S. Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> recounteth, was made in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fācy, as I may say, of the primitiue Church, to wit, in the tyme of <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour within nyne or ten yeares after the death of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> the <hi>Euangelist,</hi> and presently after the Martyrdome of this holy Bishop, who (as <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> testifyeth in this same ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) conuersed with the Apostles, and was ordayned by <hi>S. Peter</hi> himselfe to be his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour in <hi>Antioch.</hi> Besides that, he himselfe witnesseth in his <hi>Epist. ad Smyrnaeos,</hi> that he knew our Sauiour Christ, both befor &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his resurrection; wherby it appeareth that the solemn, &amp; deuout trāslatiō of holy Reliques is no late inuention, but deryued from the Apostles tyme to ours; whereof I hope <hi>M. Collins</hi> cannot desire a more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall witnes then this holy Father, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:15521:270"/> by himselfe, who you see doth not only testify the sayd translation, but also the deuout manner of it, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall benefits, which did redound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as wel to the Cittyes by the way, as also to <hi>Antioch</hi> it selfe, where they were reserued: and by the same occasion he doth also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest his owne beliefe concerning the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces, and benefits, which faythful &amp; deuout Christians do ordinarily receaue by the holy bodyes and Reliques of Saints, yea, by their very tombes &amp; monuments, and therefore seriously exhorteth his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors to haue recourse thereto.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Now then, to conclude concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> and the translation of <hi>S. Babylas</hi> (from the which I haue somewhat digressed) I may well say now to <hi>M. Collins, Obmutesce,</hi> and bid him be as silent, and dumbe, as <hi>Iulians</hi> Diuell was at <hi>Daphne,</hi> by the vertue of <hi>S. Babylas</hi> his Reliques, which (as you haue heard out of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi>) so stopt his mouth, that he was as dumbe as a stone; for what can <hi>Collins</hi> say to defend or excuse such manifest, and palpable falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to wit, his lame, &amp; corrupt allegation of the history, his absurd and false applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and his most fraudulent quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>S. Chrysostome,</hi> who you see vrgeth, &amp;
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:15521:270"/> proueth directly the admirable vertue of Holy Reliques, euen by the same history of <hi>S. Babylas,</hi> for the which <hi>Collins</hi> cyteth him against Reliques. But let vs now heare what followeth.</p>
            <p n="37">37. After this <hi>M. Collins</hi> telleth vs of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>Lucilla,</hi> a factious Dame, &amp; spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial patronesse of the Donatists, of whom he sayth, <hi>Optatus</hi> recounteth, that she was so wicked, that she would not receaue the Sacrament of our Lords body, and bloud <hi>vnlesse she had kissed the Reliques of a certaine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr that morning, if at least a Martyr, sayth</hi> Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus: <hi>Yet you are</hi> (sayth M. Collins) <hi>for kissing them very definitiuely in your number</hi> 24. <hi>And if it be lawfull to kisse them, why not also to beginne the Communion with such a seruice? And may not we say of your Martyrs, as</hi> Optatus <hi>doth of hers (of</hi> Lucilla's <hi>I meane</hi>) si tamen Martyres, <hi>if at least they be Martyrs, eyther your ancient, or your moderne? But</hi> Optatus <hi>mislikes this doting vpon Martyrs Reliques though true Martyrs, as the place sheweth.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins,</hi> wherin there is notable fraud, and a great deale of folly: but I omit the folly, to say somewhat brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly of the fraud.</p>
            <p n="38">38. You see, he sayth, that <hi>Lucilla</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to kisse the Reliques of a Martyr euery morning, before she receaued the Blessed
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:15521:271"/> Sacrament of the Eucharist, and he vrgeth it very much against me, because I am, as he sayth, <hi>for kissing Reliques very definitiuely.</hi> The truth is, that <hi>Optatus</hi> sayth, that <hi>Lucilla</hi> (who was a most wicked Schismatike, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore like inough to swarue also from the customs of true Catholiks in many things) vsed alwayes before she communicated, to kisse a bon of a dead man, which no doubt as she vsed it, was a most ridiculous, and superstitious ceremony, &amp; was taught her by <hi>Donatus</hi> the first Author of the <hi>Donatistes</hi> schisme and heresy, of whome we read in <hi>Balsamons</hi> Commentary vpon the Councell of <hi>Carthage cap.</hi> 61. that he did hould, and teach that no man could be partaker of the diuine Mysteries, except he first held a bone in his hand, and saluted it; which doctrine of his she vndoubtedly practised before she communicated, in kissing the bone of some dead man, whome the Donatists held for a Martyr, though perhaps he was none, at least <hi>nondum vindicati,</hi> sayth <hi>Optatus,</hi> not so approued to be.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Therefore this being a most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious act, it was worthily noted, and deryded by <hi>Optatus;</hi> but what proueth this against the kissing of Reliques? Yes sayth <hi>M. Collins,</hi> for if it be lawfull to kisse them,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:15521:271"/> why not also to begin the Communion with such a seruice? Wherto I answere, that albeit there is no doubt, but that we may lawfully kisse Reliques before we cōmunicate, yet to thinke that the worthy receauing of the diuine misteryes depēdeth thereon (as no doubt she did, according to the doctrine of her Maister <hi>Donatus</hi>) is, not only ridiculous, and superstitious, but also impious; as the like may also be sayd of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good works, if they should be done in the same manner.</p>
            <p n="40">40. As for example, if any man would not otherwayes receaue the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except he had first giuen almes, with this cōceit that the worthy receauing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of depēded vpon the giuing of that almes, this act no doubt should be superstitious, and vnlawfull: so as <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath heerein notably peruerted the sense and meaning of <hi>Optatus,</hi> to the end he might say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what with more shew of probability a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the kissing of Reliques; because I do approue the same in the 9. Chapter of my Adioynder <hi>num.</hi> 24. vpon occasion of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine obiections, which <hi>Vigilantius</hi> made to Catholiks in <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> tyme, saying thus: <hi>VVe see you</hi> (sayth <hi>Vigilantius) according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Gentills &amp;c. euery where kisse, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:15521:272"/> I know not what little dust carryed in a little vessell, and lapt in a pretious linnen cloath.</hi> Thus wrote <hi>Vigilantius.</hi> Whereupon I noted, that it appeared euidently by the obiection of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> that the common custome of the faythfull was at that tyme to do corporall reuerence to Reliques, not only by kissing them, but also by inclyning, or bowing downe the body vnto them, which the word <hi>adoration</hi> signifyeth, and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth it not, though he denyeth the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Idolatry, that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> made ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="41">41. Thus indeed I said then in the 24. number now cyted by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> out of tyme, and place; for where I sayd it, he passed it ouer with silence, because he durst not vndertake to answere that which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged togeather with it out of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> against <hi>Vigilantius</hi> cōcerning the worship of Reliques, &amp; therfore he fraudulently dissē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the whole, as you saw before in the the last <hi>Chapter num.</hi> 29.30: <hi>&amp;</hi> 35. Neither doth he tell heer what I sayd in particuler concerning the kissing of reliques, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayth in generall tearmes, that <hi>I am for the kissing of Reliques difinitiuely in the</hi> 24. <hi>numb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="42">42. And much lesse will he seeme to remember what I alleadged to the same
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:15521:272"/> purpose in the seauenth Chapter of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder <hi>num.</hi> 9. out of <hi>S. Gregory Nissen,</hi> who in his oration vpon <hi>S. Theodore</hi> the Martyr speaking of the feruent deuotion of the people in seeking to approach to the tomb of that holy Martyr, appealeth to their owne experience, and knowledge, how happy they did thinke themselues, when they could haue the good fortune to touch his Reliques, and how they imbraced, &amp; kissed them, &amp; applyed them to their eyes, eares, and all the instruments of their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, to all which <hi>M. Collins</hi> had not a word to say, where I alleadged it, but did let it slip without answere, togeather with the whole place of S. <hi>Gregory Nissen;</hi> and now belike he thinketh he hath sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed it by this example, which neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you see doth make no more against the kissing of Reliques, then against any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good worke, done in the same manner and vpon the like consideration.</p>
            <p n="43">43. Yea but <hi>Optatus,</hi> as M. <hi>Collins</hi> sayth, <hi>mislikes this doting on martyrs reliques, though true Martyrs;</hi> so indeed sayth M. <hi>Collins,</hi> and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth also that the place sheweth it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he belyeth <hi>Optatus</hi> manifestly, who bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Lucilla</hi> only because she did <hi>praeponere calici salutarios cuiusdā hominis mortu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, &amp; si Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyris,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:15521:273"/> sed necdum vindicati,</hi> that is to say, she preferred before the holy cup, the bone of a certaine dead man, who if he were a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, yet was not approued so to be; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it may well be gathered that <hi>Optatus</hi> accused her, to valew and esteeme more the kissing of that bone, then the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and that he signifyed the same by the word <hi>praeponere,</hi> which doth commonly signify to preferre in worth or dignity; which also is the more probable in this place, because so the sense is cōforme to the foresayd doctrine of her Maister <hi>Donatus,</hi> who placed the fruit of receauing the holy misteryes in that, or such a Ceremony.</p>
            <p n="44">44. And albeit <hi>praeponere</hi> should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken only to set before in order or place, as that she did it first, before she communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet it maketh nothing for <hi>M. Collins,</hi> seeing that <hi>Optatus</hi> doth not speake at all of a true approued Martyr, but only giueth to vnderstand, that her fault was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because she vsed that ceremōy to a bone of one that either was no Martyr, or at least not receaued, and approued for a Martyr; as who would say, that her superstition had beene yet more tollerable if she had done it to a Relique of a true, and vnapproued Martyr. And therefore <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath not
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:15521:273"/> only notably peruerted the meaning and sense of <hi>Optatus;</hi> but also belyed his text, affirming that this place sheweth that he misliketh the <hi>kissing of true Martyrs reliques,</hi> when neuertheles he doth not speake of a true Martyr, but only of a dead man (as he calleth him) who was eyther no Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, or at least an vncertaine Martyr, not receaued and approued to be honoured in the Church.</p>
            <p n="45">45. I omit his notable folly, in asking by the way, whether he may not say of our martyrs both ancient, and moderne, as <hi>Optatus</hi> sayd of <hi>Lacilla's</hi> martyr, to wit, <hi>sitamen martyres,</hi> for howsoeuer it may please him to cal in questiō our modern matyrs, yet I see not why he should doubt of our ancient Martyrs, seeing we haue no other ancient martyrs thē such as all the Church alloweth aswell as we, and of whose Martyrdome no true Christian hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto doubted: but I say, I omit this for a foolery, not worthy of further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that I may enlarge my self some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what (as I shalbe forced to do) to discouer his notable falsehood in an obiection which he maketh out of <hi>S. Gregory lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Registr. Ep. ad Constant. August.</hi> Thus then he saith of <hi>S. Gregory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="46">
               <pb n="458" facs="tcp:15521:274"/>46. <q>
                  <hi>It amazed him to heare that dead bodyes should be digged vp againe</hi> or, as the fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before had beene (<hi>S. Augustine</hi> so wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing, <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and diuers more) that the fragments of Martyrs should be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp and downe, vnder pretence of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but indeed for sale, or for gaze of idle people.</q> Thus saith <hi>M. Collins</hi> of <hi>S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and by the way also of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> with diuers more. And therefore first to speake of that which he alleadgeth out of <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> it is very true, that S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> sayth, in that epistle; that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred much at a custome which he heard was in <hi>Greece</hi> (although he could scant beleeue it) to take vp the bones of Saints. And the cause of this his wonder was, for that certayn greeke monks who had been at <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. yeares before, digged vp in the night dead mens bodyes in a feild neere to <hi>S. Pauls</hi> Church, and hid the bones thereof vntill they should depart, and being exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined after to what end they did it, they confessed, that they meant to carry them to <hi>Greece</hi> at their returne for the reliques of Saints. Wherupon <hi>S. Gregory</hi> saith, that he became more doubtful thē before, whether it was true, which was reported, that the Greekes did indeed take vp the bones of
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:15521:274"/> Saints, or that the report only grew of the imposture of such as the aforesaid monks; who meant to haue giuen abroad the bones of ordinary dead men, for the true bones, and reliques of Saints.</p>
            <p n="47">47. To this effect doth <hi>S. Gregory</hi> speak of this matter, worthily dislyking, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that abuse of the <hi>Grecians</hi> (if it were true) that the bones of Saints should be ordinarily taken vp, and distributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad at euery mans pleasure, which must needes open the way to a farre greater abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, and giue occasion to euill disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to deceiue the people with counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayt, and false reliques, in which respect it is not conuenient, neyther euer was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Roman Church, that the tombes or graues of Saints should be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor their reliques taken out, without iust cause, and the licence of the Bishops, or other Ecclesiasticall magistrates; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which <hi>S. Gregory</hi> misliked, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued cōcerning the digging vp of Sains bones, was no other, but the ordinary custome of it, without the licence and warrant of Superiors, and without some iust occasion; for <hi>S. Gregory</hi> was so far frō dissallowing it, when it was done vpon vrgent, and iust cause, with the leaue of
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:15521:275"/> Superiors, that he practised the same him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, both giuing leaue to others to do it, and sending holy reliques himselfe to dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers persons and places.</p>
            <p n="48">48. This appeareth in diuers epistles of his, as in the 11. Epistle of his seauenth booke <hi>Indict.</hi> 2. wherein he gaue order to seauen Bishops to giue satisfaction to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man called <hi>George,</hi> who had required leaue of him to haue some Reliques of such holy Martyrs as were buryed in their dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, with promise to build a Church in their honour, at his owne charges; also <hi>ep.</hi> 73. <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Indict.</hi> 4. he gaue the like order to the Bishop of <hi>Hidruntum,</hi> to giue some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the body of S. <hi>Leontius</hi> (which was buryed in his diocesse) to the Abbot of the Monastery of S. <hi>Leontius,</hi> because certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the sayd Saint had been stolne out of that Monastery. Also <hi>epist.</hi> 50. <hi>l</hi> 5. <hi>Indict.</hi> 14. he wrote to <hi>Palladius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Xaintonges</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> that he sent him the reliques of <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul, S. Laurence,</hi> and <hi>S. Pancrace,</hi> because the sayd Bishop had built a Church and altars in honour of them.</p>
            <p n="49">49. In like manner <hi>ep.</hi> 31. <hi>lib.</hi> 12. <hi>Indict.</hi> 7. it appeareth that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> our Apostle being in England, and finding that the people were perswaded, that the body of S.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:15521:275"/>
               <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Martyr was there (which he thought altogeather vnprobable) required of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to send him some vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted reliques of <hi>S. Sixus,</hi> which he did with this charge, that if there were no miracles don at that body, which was there honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for a Martyrs body, neither yet that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ancienter sort could testify that they had heard of his martyrdome by their parents, then the place where the body lay should be stopped vp, &amp; the reliques which he sent, should be placed a part by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>Nec permittatur populus,</hi> sayth he, <hi>certū deserere, &amp; incertum venerari; &amp; let not the people be suffered to leaue that which is certaine, to worship that which is vncertaine.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Gregory</hi> to <hi>S. Augustine</hi> the first Apostle of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish nation, by whom we were conuerted from Paganisme to the Christian fayth.</p>
            <p n="50">50. And this I wish M. <hi>Collins</hi> to note for three causes: the first, that he may see S. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> practise of sending reliques, so far as from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> to be there held in veneration: the second, that he may also obserue what care as well S. <hi>Gregory</hi> as S. <hi>Augustin</hi> had to preserue the people from the worshipping of false Reliques, which care is still had in the Catholike Church, as shal appeare after a whyle: the third, that we
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:15521:276"/> receaued in our Countrey the doctrine, and practise of worshipping holy Reliques, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather with the knowledge of Christ, and the first rudiments of our Christian fayth, now more then a thousand yeares ago.</p>
            <p n="51">51. And he that desireth to see more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant testimony of S. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> fayth, &amp; practise, concerning this point, let him read his <hi>Epistle</hi> 51. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Indict.</hi> 14. <hi>ep.</hi> 12. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Indict.</hi> 2. <hi>ep.</hi> 86. 87. <hi>&amp;</hi> 88. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>Indict.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; epist.</hi> 62. <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>Indict.</hi> 3. to omit diuers others, by all which it appeareth, that either he himselfe translated and sent Reliques, or els gaue leaue to others to translate or send them for the dedication, and consecration of Oratoryes, or Churches, with order that they should be layd vp, and kept <hi>cum reuerentia, &amp; debito honore,</hi> with reuerence, &amp; due honour, as he wrote to <hi>Brunechilda</hi> Queene of <hi>France</hi> concerning the Reliques of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> which he sent her at her request. And this custome of dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, or consecrating Churches with the Reliques of Saints, was obserued not only in S. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> tyme (as it hath beene euer since) but in the tyme also of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who sent part of the reliques of <hi>SS. Gerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> and <hi>Protasius</hi> to diuers of his friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, by the occasion whereof Churches
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:15521:276"/> were built, &amp; dedicated to those Saints in diuers Countryes, as I haue signifyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p n="52">52. But to shew the extraordinary respect, reuerence, and deuotion which S. <hi>Gregory</hi> bare, and thought to be due to holy reliques, there can be no greater testimony then that very Epistle of his to <hi>Constantia</hi> the Empresse, out of which Maister <hi>Collins</hi> hath picked this scrapp, whereof I haue hither to treated; and therefore, to the end you may see his bad Conscience, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full blyndenes, I will take a little paynes to giue you the substance of the whole. This Empresse being to build a Church in the honour of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> wrote to <hi>S. Gregory</hi> to send her his head, or els some part of his body, to which he answered, that he nei- could nor durst do it, whereof he gaue this reason; because (saith he) <hi>the bodyes of</hi> S. Peter, <hi>and</hi> S. Paul <hi>the Apostles do shyne with so many miracles, &amp; terrours in their Churches, that none can come so much as to pray there, without great feare;</hi> and of this he giueth diuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; first of his predecessour, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about to chaunge the syluer which was ouer the most holy body of S. <hi>Peter</hi> (at the least 15. foote from it) was not a little terrifyed with a signe or miraculous sight
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:15521:277"/> which appeared vnto him. <hi>Sed &amp; ego</hi> (sayth he) <hi>aliquid similiter &amp;c. And I also was desirous to mend some thing about the most sacred body of</hi> S. Paul, <hi>and for that it was necessary to digge some. what deep neere vnto the tombe; he who had charge of the place, found there certaine bones somewhat separate from the tomb, and because he presumed to take them vp, and to remoue them to another place, he dyed suddenly, besydes that other dolefull signes, or spectacles also appeared there.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Gregory</hi> of his owne experience.</p>
            <p n="53">53. And hauing after related the like miraculous punishment inflicted by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God vpon diuers who presuming to see the body of S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> died all with in tenne dayes after, he addeth, that the custome was at <hi>Rome,</hi> when reliques were to be giuē, not to touch the Saints bodyes, but only to apply a handkerchiffe therto, and to keepe yt, <hi>cum debita veneratione,</hi> with due veneration, in the Church which was to be dedicated, <hi>Et tantae</hi> (saith <hi>S. Gregory) per hoc ibidem virtutes fiunt, ac si illuc illorum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pora specialiter deserantur; and as great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are done thereby, as if the Saints bodyes were speically carryed thither; whereupon it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> (saith he also further) <q>
                  <hi>that in the tyme of Pope Leo</hi> of happy memory (as we haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by tradition from our fore fathers) he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:15521:277"/> did cut in sunder such a hand-cherchiffe with a payre of Cyzers for the satisfactiō of certaine Grecians who doubted of such reliques, and there issued bloud out of it; for amongst the Romans, &amp; in all the East parts, it is held to be altogeather intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and sacrilegious to touch the bodyes of Saints; and if any presume to do it, <hi>Certum est, quia haec temeritas impunita nullo modo rema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebit: it is certaine that their temerity shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnpunished.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="54">54. Thus sayth <hi>S. Gregory,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth vpon these premisses, that he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meruaileth very much, and can scantly belieue it, that the Grecians had such a custome as was reported, to take vp the bones of Saints; and then vpon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he recounteth that which I haue layd downe before, concerning the Greeke Monkes, who digged vp dead mens bones to carry into <hi>Greece</hi> for reliques. By all which it is euident, that albeit he blameth and greatly disliketh the abuse of the sayd Greeke Monks (which indeed was detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and therefore worthy to be blamed, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>euerely punished) yet he acknowledgeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> manifestly the honour due to reliques, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> if M. <hi>Collins</hi> did read the Epistle it selfe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> not take the obiection out of some
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:15521:278"/> other mans note-booke without seeing the circumstances) he sheweth himselfe to a a man of no conscience, or honesty, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it against the veneration of reliques, seeing it doth so testify, and proue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynes of them, that it may rather terrify a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man from touching them, for the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent respect due vnto them, then moue him to reiect or disesteeme them.</p>
            <p n="55">55. But <hi>M. Collins</hi> will say perhaps, that he alleadgeth this to prooue two thinges, the one, <hi>That the fragments of Martyrs are not to be carryed vp &amp; downe vnder pretence of deuotion, for sale, or for gaze of idle people</hi> (for so indeed he sayth;) the other, <hi>that dead bodyes should not be digged vp againe, or translated:</hi> both which points, he will say this Epistle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth directly; whereto I answere, that if he did acknowledge the truth of <hi>S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> doctrine in this Epistle, concerning the veneration of holy reliques, he might with more reason allea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge this other, as he doth; to proue that they should not be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated or digged vp; but seeing he maketh vse of this only, which may seeme to serue his purpose; and not only condemneth the other, but also craftily concealeth it (to make his Reader belieue, that <hi>S. Grego<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> disaloweth the digging vp of Saints bones,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:15521:278"/> because he condemneth the veneration of them) this, I say, is an intollerable fraud, and much the more because the circumstā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (which he fraudulently dissembleth) being considered, do plainely shew, that al that which he alleadgeth is nothing to the purpose.</p>
            <p n="56">56. For as for the first of the two points for which he produceth this testimony (to wit to proue that the reliques of Martyrs, are not to be carryed about for sale vnder pretence of deuotion) it maketh nothing at all against vs, who condemne the same as much, or more then he, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he may see by the Canons of the Catholike Church, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the 62. Canon of the great Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> where it is expresly forbidden to sell holy reliques, as also to expose new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to veneration except they be first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Authority of the Pope. And this is also expresly noted by all the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, as may be seene in <hi>Panormit. cap. Cum ex eo num.</hi> 1. <hi>Rub. de reliquijs &amp; vener. Hostien, lib</hi> 3. <hi>Rubr. de reliquijs.</hi> Syluest. <hi>verb. Reliquiae</hi> &amp; to omit others, <hi>Nauar. in sum. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>num.</hi> 169.</p>
            <p n="57">57. Finally the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath had such care to preuent, and remedy all such abuses concerning holy reliques, that
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:15521:279"/> they haue giuen very strict charg &amp; cōmā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement <hi>sess.</hi> 25. to all Bishops to vse all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to that end, and in questions, or cases of doubt or difficulty to vse the mature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, not only of Deuines, but also (if need require) of the Metropolitans and Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Councells, and yet so, that no new thing, or custome that hath not beene v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Church before shalbe introduced without the consent of the Sea Apostolik: such care hath the Catholike Church to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd all inconueniences, &amp; abuses which may arise either by the inordinate zeale of ignorant people, or by the malice of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. And therefore if M. <hi>Collins</hi> will condemne the vse and worship of holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, because they haue beene, or may be abused, he sheweth himselfe to be very absurd, and sottish; for he may by the same reason condemne whatsoeuer is good, and holy in the Church of God; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is vsed, but it may be, &amp; hath been at one tyme or other abused. And this shall suffice for this point.</p>
            <p n="58">58. As for the other point which <hi>M. Collins</hi> seeketh to proue by this epistle (to wit that the bones of Saints, are not to be digged vp or translated) it is to be vnderstood, that <hi>S. Gregory</hi> affirmeth it specially concerning
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:15521:279"/> those bodyes of the Apostles <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and of <hi>S. Laurence,</hi> because Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God had shewed by euident signes, and miracles, that it was not his will they should be remoued or touched, as you haue heard, which <hi>S. Gregory</hi> sheweth also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes more manifestly, saying; that very many Christians came to <hi>Rome</hi> from the Easts parts (when the Apostles were marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) to demand their bodyes, as of their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, or Countreymen, and that going to the place where they were buryed called <hi>Catacumbas,</hi> two myles out of <hi>Rome,</hi> they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed al their endeauour to carry them away, and that they were so terrifyed with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thunder, and lightning, that they gaue it ouer, and presumed not to attempt it further; whereupon (sayth <hi>S. Gregory) Exuntes Romani, eorum corpora qui hoc ex Domini pietate meruerunt, leuauerunt, &amp; in locis quibus nunc condita sunt, posuerunt,</hi> The Romans who deserued it through our Lords piety, went forth, and tooke vp their bodyes, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them wher they are now buryed. Thus sayth <hi>S. Gregory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="59">59. Wherin it is to be noted, that those holy bodyes being first buryed in <hi>Catacum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> two myles out of <hi>Rome,</hi> were taken vp, and translated from thence into <hi>Rome</hi> by the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:15521:280"/>
               <hi>Romans,</hi> which could not haue beene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done, if it were absolutly vnlawful to take vp and translate Saints bodyes. But afterwards when Almighty God had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed euidently that it was his holy will and pleasure, that they should not only remain in <hi>Rome,</hi> but also be vnseene and vntouched (in respect of the great veneration wherein he would haue them to be held) <hi>S. Gregory</hi> had great reason to feare Gods punishmēt, in case he should suffer them to be touched or seene, as King <hi>Dauid</hi> feared with like reason to touch the <hi>Arke,</hi> or to bring it into his Citty, after that <hi>Oza</hi> was strocken with sudden death for staying it, and houlding it vp when it was like to fall 2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6. And therefore <hi>S. Gregory</hi> refused in like manner to send to the Empresse the napkin (wherin <hi>S. Paules</hi> head was wrapped) saying to her thus: <hi>Sudarium quod similiter transmitti iussisti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <q>The winding-sheet which you also cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be sent you, is with his body; and as the body may not be approached, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may the sayd sheet be touched: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the religious desire of so Gratious a Lady ought not to be frustrated, I wil with speed send you some part of the chaynes, which the holy Apostle <hi>S. Paul</hi> bare vpon his neck, and handes (by the which many
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:15521:280"/> miracles are shewed) if I can get from them any part thereof with a fyle; for it falleth out often that when many come, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand some benediction from those chayns (by hauing some little part of the filings of them) the Priest standeth by with the fyle; and for some of those who demaund it, some litle is easily and speedily filed of; but for some others, nothing at all can be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the chaynes, though they be fyled neuer so long.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="60">60. Thus sayth <hi>S. Gregory;</hi> and with this he endeth his Epistle, hauing recounted as you see, so many stupendious thinges, to shew the great respect, and honour due to holy Reliques, that Maister <hi>Collins</hi> may be thought no lesse senseles then shameles to produce this Epistle, or any thing in it, against the veneration of them, especially, seeing that which <hi>S. Gregory</hi> sayth also in general (touching his mislike of the taking vp of Saints bones) tendeth only to the greater honour of them, his meaning being no other (as I haue declared before <hi>num</hi> 42.) but that they should not be taken vp (in respect of the reuerence due vnto them) without iust cause, and leaue of Superiours which is alwayes iustly graunted, when it may be to the greater glory of God, and of
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:15521:281"/> his Saints, in which case <hi>S. Gregory</hi> himself practised it, as you haue seene in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alleadged before out of his owne Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in this Chapter, <hi>num.</hi> 48. 49. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51.</p>
            <p n="61">61. Whereby it appeareth that albeit he neither would, nor durst cōsent that the bodyes of <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul,</hi> or <hi>S. Laurence</hi> shold be taken vp, or any reliques taken from thē (by reason of the manifest demonstration, which Almighty God had shewed of his wil, that they should not be so much as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or seene) yet he gaue leaue that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques should be taken from the bodyes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saintes, for the dedication of new Churches, and Altars, and other iust res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; yea, and he himselfe sent also to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers abroad reliques euen of <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul</hi> and <hi>S. Laurence;</hi> such reliques, I meane, as were already separated from their bodyes and had beene in former tymes reserued, as it appeareth in his Epistle to <hi>Palladius</hi> cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before <hi>num.</hi> 48. as also in his Epistle to <hi>Brunechilda</hi> Queen of <hi>France num.</hi> 51. and the same is in like māner euident inough euen in this Epistle to the Empresse: for althogh he denyed to send her <hi>S. Pauls</hi> head, or the linnen cloath wherin the same was wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped (for the reason before declared) yet he promised to send her some of the fylings of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:15521:281"/> his chayns, which were kept separate from his body; so as there can be no doubt of S. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> beliefe, and doctrine concerning the vse and veneration of holy reliques; but it may well be doubted, whether <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath any sparke of shame or honesty in him, who seeing such aboundant testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in S. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> Epistles of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent respect and honour which he bare to holy Reliques, doth neuerthelesse witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; willfully abuse his authority against them; and no meruaile, seeing he doth the like with <hi>S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, S. Hierome,</hi> and <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> alleadging them against the translation, and veneration of holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, when they, as you haue already seen do all of them clearely testify and approue the practise thereof.</p>
            <p n="62">62. This being so, what need I trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my selfe, and my Reader, with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answere to his <hi>Parenthesis</hi> cōcerning <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> who, he sayth, do witnesse, <hi>that the fashion was before S.</hi> Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes <hi>tyme, to carry fragments of Martyrs vp and downe for sale?</hi> For is it not euident by the premisses, that both <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> did highly approue the solemne, and deuout translation of holy Reliques? With what face thē, doth this brazē-faced fellow
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:15521:282"/> obiect against vs, their dislike, and reproof of the abuse of holy reliques, which we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so condēne no lesse thē they, punishing the delinquents, when occasion requireth? But because he setteth downe in his margent these wordes of <hi>S. Augustine: Noui multos sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrorum adoratores &amp;c.</hi> I know there are many that do adore sepulchers &amp;c. and addeth also afterwardes, a testimony of <hi>Gregorius Turonensis,</hi> touching one that had a satchel of Rats bones, and Rootes, and teeth of Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and the fat of Bears, which he distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the people for reliques; <hi>S. Augustine</hi> himselfe shall answere M. <hi>Collins</hi> for both in the same place, where he hath the words obiected by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> to wit, in his first Booke <hi>de moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae cap.</hi> 34.</p>
            <p n="63">63. But first it is to be vnderstood, that the <hi>Manicheans</hi> in those dayes obiected against the Catholiques (as <hi>M. Collins</hi> doth now) aswell certaine abuses of ignorant, and superstitious men, as the bad liues of some others, and among other things, that there were some who adored the tombes of Martyrs (eyther with diuyne honour, or with some superstitious Ceremonies, in which respect they called them, <hi>sepulchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum adoratores</hi>) which <hi>S. Augustine</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be true, and therfore answereth
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:15521:282"/> them, that they should not obiect vnto him such as professe the Christian religiō, and eyther do not knowe the force of their profession, or doe not practise it; neither yet that they should obiect a Company of ignorant men, who eyther are superstitious in religion it self, or so giuen ouer to their lust, and pleasure, that they forget, what they haue promised to God. And he sayth further to the Manichees thus; <hi>It is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, that in such multitudes of people (as professe the Christian religion) there want not some, by whose bad lyues you may deceaue the vnwary, and auert them from the saluation which they may haue by the Catholique faith &amp;c. Nunc autem illud vos admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo &amp;c. but now I do admonish or aduise you of this, viz. to leaue your rayling vpon the Catholike Church blaming the manners of men, whom the Church it selfe condemneth, and dayly laboureth to correct and reforme as bad Children.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> to the <hi>Manichees;</hi> and so say I to <hi>M. Collins,</hi> to make him capable, if it may be, that neither the abuse of some Catholiques in the exercise or practise of religion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet the bad liues of some others can preiudice the integrity, and purity of the Catholique fayth, and doctryne; and so he himselfe and his fellowes would quickly tell vs, if we should obiect against
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:15521:283"/> them, the mōstrous bad liues of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (manifest to all England at the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke Assises, and Sessions) and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold abuses committed by diuers of them in the exercise of their function, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Therefore whereas he obiecteth against vs the foresayd abuses of reliques, reproued by foure auncient Fathers, (<hi>S. Augustine, S. Hierome, S. Gregory</hi> the great, &amp; <hi>S. Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Towers</hi>) we require of him, that as we condemne the same abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with those Fathers; so also he will acknowledge and approue with them and vs, the veneration of holy reliques, which they acknowledg and approue as you haue seene already in three of them, that is to say, in Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the great. And the same is no lesse euident in the fourth, to wit, in Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Towers,</hi> who hath writtē two notable books <hi>de gloria Martyrū,</hi> and <hi>de gloriae Confessorum;</hi> the substance whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof is nothing els, but a relation of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest miracles done at the Tombes, or by the reliques of Martyrs and Confessors, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon such as with deuotion, and reuerence had recourse vnto them.</p>
            <p n="65">65. Therefore a man may wonder at
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:15521:283"/> the impudency of this fellow, who is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shamed to make this holy father an abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his impiety in impugning holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, only because he doth with dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statiō recount the history of a sacrilegious Nigromācer, who deceiued deuout people with counterfait, and false reliques; in which story neuerthelesse there is most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident testimony aswell of the Authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent respect and deuotion to holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, as also of the praictise of the Church in the veneration of them which I omit for breuityes sake. And therefore whereas <hi>M. Collins</hi> concludeth his marginall note cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the testimony of this Father, with this question, <hi>Is it not pitty, that we Englishmen will not traffike with the Iesuits for such ghostly cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modityes</hi> (meaning rats bones, the teeth of moales, &amp; such like;) I would gladly know of <hi>M. Collins</hi> what Iesuits (yea or what other Catholique man in this age) he can name that hath euer made traffick with such wares; &amp; if he cannot name any (whereof I am well assured) then I may well aske him, whether it is not great pitty, and shame, that Englishmen should haue such pastors of their soules, such preachers, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and writers, as make no conscience to lye, slaunder, and backbite, <hi>quorum os
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:15521:284"/> maledictione, &amp; amaritudine plenum est. psal.</hi> 13. whose mouth is full of malediction and bitternesse; whose throate is <hi>sepulchrum pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens,</hi> an open Sepulcher; and the venime of <hi>Aspis</hi> is vnder their lyps; yea, <hi>&amp; voloces pedes eorum ad effundendum sanguinem,</hi> their feet are swift to spill bloud, as wee find by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience when we fall into their fingers: but God forgiue them, and send them more Charity, and the light of his grace.</p>
            <p n="66">66. There followeth in M. <hi>Collins</hi> a place out of <hi>Origen contra Celsum lib.</hi> 8. which he sayth he had omitted, so as it seemed to him to be of such importance, that it might not be passed ouer with silence. <hi>VVe haue learned,</hi> saith <hi>Origen, to recommend honorably to the graue the instruments of the soule reasonable,</hi> that is, (sayth <hi>M. Collins) the bodyes of men, and the members thereof: Therefore not to make reliques of them.</hi> So he; which he might very well haue stil omitted, and kept in store, vntill he had met with some man, who would deny that dead men should be buryed, which we do not; for we do bury not only euery dead man (houlding it for a great worke of Charity) but also the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyest men, albeyt we do also afterwards honour theyr tombs, bodyes, and reliques when Almighty God hath giuen vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:15521:284"/> testimony of their sanctity, by miracls, or by the iudgment of the Church; yea and sometymes we take them vp agayn, &amp; translate them with greater honour, and solemnity, for Gods greater glory, and theyrs; so as we do thē honour in burying of them, and more honour in translating them, as it is euident in the examples of the Saints before mentioned; to wit, the Apostles <hi>S. Peter, S. Paul, S. Andrew, S. Luke, S. Tymothy, Samuel</hi> the prophet, <hi>S. Ignatius, S. Babylas, S. Geruase,</hi> and <hi>Protase,</hi> who were buryed honourably by the Christians then liuing, and translated after with farre gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater honour to God, and them. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore <hi>M. Collins</hi> his argument out of <hi>Origen</hi> is such a silly one, as that he might very well haue omitted it, and I also haue let it passe for one of his ordinary fooleryes, but that I note in it the same fraud that he vsed before in the like places of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> whereby he chaunged the state of the question from Saints (of whom we speak) to ordinary dead men, of whom <hi>Origen,</hi> &amp; <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> speake; for of them there is to be had farre different considerations, as I haue declared before.</p>
            <p n="67">67. Next after this, he addeth two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exampls against Reliques out of <hi>Victor
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:15521:285"/> Vticensis de persecutione Vandalica lib.</hi> 1. <q>The first of <hi>Armogastes,</hi> sayth he, <hi>a godly Christian who desired Faelix</hi> (another of the profession) <hi>sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liri sub arbore siliquae,</hi> i. that being dead, he might be buryed vnder a homely tree (if a tree) not with triumph, and fauour, or solemnity.</q> So he. And then addeth further thus: <hi>As for the Sarcophagus</hi> which appeared, <q>as it were by miracle, in the place by him allotted for his buryall, I impute that to the satisfaction of his godly desire, about a quicke consumption or turning into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then which nothing can be more repugnant to your ceremony of Reliques.</q> Thus sayth M. <hi>Collins,</hi> telling vs a tale of a tub, speaking of a <hi>Sarcophagus,</hi> so obscurely, that no man who hath not read the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can tell what it meaneth. Therfore that you may vnderstand the whole, and see his fraud withall, I will briefly relate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as it passed.</p>
            <p n="68">68. This <hi>Armogastes</hi> hauing beene ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes extremely tormented by the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls</hi> for the Catholik fayth, and hauing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the same with inuincible courage, and constancy, was at length made to keep Cattle neere to <hi>Carthage,</hi> &amp; hauing after a whyle a reuelation from Almighty of his death, to succeed within few dayes, he
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:15521:285"/> most earnestly intreated a friend of his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Faelix</hi> (who did often visit him) to bury him vnder a tree, when he should be dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; which <hi>Faelix</hi> denyed to graunt him a long tyme, telling him that he should be buryed in a Church <hi>cum triumpho &amp; gratia,</hi> that is to say with triumph and solemnity, as was conuenient.</p>
            <p n="69">69. Neuerthelesse in the end being charged deeply by him in conscience as he would answere it before God, he promised him to satisfy his desire. Within a few dayes after <hi>Armogastes</hi> dyed, and <hi>Faelix</hi> meaning to performe his promise, digged with great difficulty, through the rootes of the Tree, <hi>Et tandem</hi> (sayth <hi>Victor) abscissis radicibus, multò altiùs terram cauans, inuenit Sarcophagum splendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissimi marmoris praeparatum, qualem fortè nullus omnino habuit Regum:</hi> And at length digging much deeper, and the roots of the Tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut away, he found a Tombe of most bright shining Marble ready made, such a one as perhaps neuer any King had the like. Thus sayth <hi>Victor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="70">70. Now good Reader, I leaue it to thy Iudgment, whether any thing can be iustly picked out of this history against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; or rather whether the contrary may not be gathered thereof, seeing it appeareth
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:15521:286"/> thereby, how much Almighty God hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the dead body of this his seruant, for the which he miraculously prepared so rich and magnificent a sepulcher. And whereas <hi>M. Collins</hi> vrgeth two points therein for his purpose: the one, that <hi>Armogastes</hi> would be buryed simply vnder a homely tree, not <hi>cum triumpho &amp; gratia,</hi> not with fauour, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity: and the other, that he desired a quicke consumption, which sayth <hi>M. Collins</hi> is most repugnant <hi>to your ceremony of Reliques,</hi> he is most ridiculous in both, and in the later not ōly ridiculous, but also fraudulēt. I say ridiculous, because the contrary of that which he supposeth doth rather fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thereof.</p>
            <p n="71">71. For what can be gathered of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both, but that <hi>Armogastes</hi> was so hū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he esteemed himself vnworthy of all honour, &amp; respect, or so much as of any memory amongst men, which made him most honourable, and glorious in the sight of God, according to the saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, <hi>qui se humiliat, exaltabitur,</hi> and therfore this humility was so farre from hindring his desert to be honoured after his death, that being testifyed by Almighty God, with the honour of such a miraculous bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, it made his very memory and reliques
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:15521:286"/> much more venerable and honourable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, what a silly fellow is <hi>M. Collins</hi> to think that any holy mā doth esteem himself worthy to be held for a Saint, or his body, and reliques worthy of worship after his death, which only conceit might suffice to depriue him of Gods fauour, and grace, &amp; consequently of eternall blisse. Wil he then argue thus; <hi>Armogastes</hi> desired a homely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and to be quickly consumed; <hi>Ergo</hi> there ought to be no Reliques of him or of any els? Or therefore reliques are not to be worshipped? Who seeth not the absurdity of these consequents? Seeing that which may be inferred vpon those premisses, is this, that he himselfe desired out of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility that there should be no reliques, nor further memory of him, which as I haue sayd, did greatly increase his merit, and make him much more worthy of honour.</p>
            <p n="72">72. But if I should aske <hi>M. Collins</hi> where he hath found that <hi>Armogastes</hi> desired to be quickly consumed to nothing, he would tell me (no doubt) that he found it in the <hi>Sarcophagus,</hi> which <hi>Faelix</hi> found by digging vnder the tree, because <hi>Plyny</hi> telleth of a kind of stone found at a Citty called <hi>Assus,</hi> neere to <hi>Troy</hi> in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> the property wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to consume dead bodyes, all but the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:15521:287"/> teeth, within fourty dayes, which stone is therfore called <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> in Greek com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> flesh, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to eate; so as <hi>M. Collins</hi> must by this meanes imagine that <hi>Armogastes</hi> knowing by reuelation, not onely that there was a tombe vnder that Tree, where he desired to be buryed, but also that it was made of that stone, orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be buryed there, to the end he might be presently consumed, and nothing left of him to make reliques off.</p>
            <p n="73">73. Neuerthelesse if we should graunt all this to be true, the matter would not not be altogeather cleare; for so <hi>Armogastes</hi> must also know (if he knew the property of that stone by reuelation) that his teeth would remaine vnconsumed, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be made reliques, whereby his desire of a totall consumption should not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, nor <hi>M. Collins</hi> his argument against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, proued altogeather so sound as he would haue it. But truely, albeit I cannot but cōmend him for his fine deuise, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pretty wit, and that he hath som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> smacke aswell in <hi>Grammer,</hi> as in <hi>Plynyes</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall history; yet I must needs condemne him of no small fraud, in that he wresteth the sense of the word <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="485" facs="tcp:15521:287"/> to wit, to one kind of tombe, made only of that stone, which the very wordes of the Author, and the circumstances doe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict; for as for the common vse thereof in Greeke or Latin, I report me to the Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naryes of either language, as to <hi>Henricus Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,</hi> and to <hi>Scapula</hi> for the <hi>Greeke,</hi> who do expound <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and signifyeth a tombe, wherein dead men are layd; and this I note the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> because he was an <hi>African,</hi> as <hi>Victor</hi> was, who writeth this sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Armogastes</hi> in the same age, &amp; therfore no doubt vsed the word <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> in the sense, which S. <hi>Augustin</hi> sayth was commō to all, as all other Latin Authours of the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:15521:288"/> ensuing ages haue done, namely <hi>S. Gregori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Turonensis,</hi> who hath the same words in the same sense.</p>
            <p n="74">74. But to put the matter out of all doubt, the very text, and wordes of <hi>Victor</hi> do expresly exclude this cōceit of <hi>M. Collins,</hi> seeing he sayth, that <hi>Faelix</hi> hauing digged very deep, <hi>inuenit Sarcophagum splēdidiffimi mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris,</hi> found a tombe of most bright, and shining Marble; and therefore it was not made of the stone called <hi>Sarcophagus,</hi> which according to <hi>Dioscorides lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 142. is <hi>leuis, fungosus, &amp; friabilis,</hi> light, spūgy, or soft like a musrumpe, and easily to be crumbled, whereas marble is a most hard and solide stone; and albeit some kind of Marble is soster then other (as the white which is called <hi>Alabaster</hi>) yet there is none among all the kinds (which <hi>Plyny,</hi> or any other recoū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) that is light, spungy, and crumbling as <hi>Dioscorides</hi> describeth <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> to be, &amp; therefore <hi>Iacobus Delachampius</hi> in his annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vpon <hi>Plyny lib.</hi> 36. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. obserueth that some Authours do say, that <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> or <hi>lapis Assius</hi> is a kind of the stone called <hi>Pyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> which is of the nature of fire (according to the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the word) &amp; that others hould it to be a kind of pumishston; which is the lightest, and most spungy stone that
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:15521:288"/> is; so as, in the opinion of all these it is very different from the nature of Marble.</p>
            <p n="75">75. And put the case it were some kind of Marble, or might be so called, yet <hi>M. Collins</hi> should haue no reason to take it in this place for a Tombe made of that one kind of Marble, seeing the word <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> was (as I haue sayd) at that tyme when the story was written generally vnderstood for any Tombe made of what matter soeuer, and that it was also expressed in the Text of the history, that it was <hi>splendidissimi mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris,</hi> of most bright and shining Marble, which cannot be applyed to this stone, wherein there is no splendour or brightnes obserued by Authors. And if <hi>M. Collins</hi> wil say, that the Etimology of the word (signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying an eating, or deuouring of flesh) might well induce him so to expound it, then why is it not also to be taken so in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, alleadged by me before out of <hi>Iuuenall,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine, Gregorius Turonensis,</hi> &amp; others, where it is euident that it signifyeth a Tombe, in generall? Or rather why doth he take <hi>Pon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ifex,</hi> and <hi>Episcopus</hi> for a Bishop, (which according to the <hi>Etymology</hi> should signify a Bridg-maker) and a superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or ouerseer? or why doth he take <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones</hi> for theeues, and not for such as guard
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:15521:289"/> Princes going by their sides for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as the word did signify at the first?</p>
            <p n="76">76. Therefore as he should be held for ridiculous, and a very Asse, that would now leaue the common vse of these words to vnderstand, and interprete them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Etimology or first origen ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, so may good M. <hi>Collins</hi> be held for no lesse, if he will leaue the common vse, and sense of <hi>Sarcophagus</hi> (which all men take for a tombe in generall) to vnderstand it for a tombe made of one certaine stone, eyther because the Etymology thereof agreeth therewith, or because perhaps at the first it might haue some deriuatiō from thence, which neuerthelesse, is not necessary, seing that any Tombe, or graue may be properly called <hi>Sarcophagus,</hi> or <hi>Carniuorus,</hi> because it doth indeed deuoure, &amp; in tyme consume mens bodyes, and turne them to dust.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Thus thou seest, good Reader, how much I haue presumed of thy patiēce to debate so largely with <hi>M. Collins</hi> this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion partly Grammaticall, and partly Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall, aswell to shew his ignorance, both in Grammer, and history, as also to confute his extrauagant conceit, grounded vpon no better foundation then his owne fraudulent dissimulation of the Authours
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:15521:289"/> text and meaning, which being duly way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghed doth rather make notably against him, then any way for him, as I doubt not, but thou hast seene, and noted sufficiently. And this shall suffice for one of the two exampls, which he alleadgeth out of <hi>Victor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="78">78. <q>The other is of a Bishop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> called <hi>Deogratias,</hi> whose worthy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, sayth <hi>M. Collins,</hi> the people out of their zeale might haue violently snatcht away, or pulled asunder, <hi>Nisi consilio Prudentum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciente multitudine sepeliretur,</hi> 1. vnlesse he had beene buryed, whyles the people did not know of it, at the direction, and suggestion of wisemen; so as to resist your reliquati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (the true bankruptures of religion) is wisedome to <hi>Victor,</hi> &amp; to the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians that liued before him.</q> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins,</hi> alleadging this example much more truly, then he hath done the former.</p>
            <p n="79">79. But albeit there is no fraud in the example, yet there is notable folly in his inference theron; for how doth it follow of this act of those wisemen, eyther that it is wisedome to resist our reliquations (to vse his absurd phrase) or that the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and veneration of reliques are, the bankruptures of Religion? Whereof rather the contrary may be gathered by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:15521:290"/> seeing it appeareth euidently ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, how much the reliques of holy men were esteemed, and desired at that tyme, although wise men thought it necessary (as it was indeed) not to suffer the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant multitude to preuent the iudgment of the Church by their indiscreet zeale, and to reuerence the Reliques (though of neuer so holy men) before the Church had approued them.</p>
            <p n="80">80. And therefore as those wise men (of whom <hi>Victor</hi> speaketh) buryed the body to saue it from the violence of the indiscreet multitude, so the like hath beene full often and is in like occasion practised by Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, whereof we had an euident example a few yeares ago in the funeralls of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, of whome I am sure, it will do M. <hi>Collins</hi> good at the very hart to heare, for the loue he bareth to our Society, I meane our last Father Generall <hi>Claudius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quauiua</hi> of happy memory, who being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout al his Generalate, no lesse renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and famous for his religious, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, then for the Nobility, and worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his lineage (being sonne to the Duke of <hi>Atri</hi>) was held in such veneration of the people, that when his body was brought forth to be buryed, they pressed with great
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:15521:290"/> violence to approach the hearse, and to get som reliques of him, by tearing the cloaths wherewith his body was vested (as the manner is heere) which they attempted, &amp; violently got his Cap from his head; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Fathers of the Society were fayne to vse extraordinary endeauour, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to repell them, and to carry away his body from them by force into the Sacristy, and afterwardes to bury it secretly in the night.</p>
            <p n="81">81. Now then albeyt this was done no doubt, <hi>consilio prudenti,</hi> by wise councell or aduise (as <hi>Victor</hi> sayth of the other) yet I hope <hi>M. Collins</hi> will not inferre hereupon, that our Fathers did think that the reliques of Saints are not to be kept, &amp; worshipped, or yet that they would not highly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and reuerence the reliques of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, if the Church had canonized, and declared him for a Saynt, and the same is to be said of those wisemen of whome <hi>Victor</hi> speaketh.</p>
            <p n="82">82. And whereas <hi>M. Collins</hi> saith, that our <hi>reliquations are the bankruptures of religion;</hi> truly he is so fyne, and spruse in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that I knowe not well whether I vnderstand him or no (for I cannot tell well what he meaneth by <hi>reliquations,</hi> or by
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:15521:291"/> bankeruptures otherwayes then by ghesse) but if I ghesse aright, &amp; that he meane that by the veneration of reliques, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come bankrupts in religion, what will he say of all those Fathers before mentioned, who cannot be denyed to haue honoured holy reliques, to wit, <hi>S. Hierome, S. Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Chrisostome. S. Gregory Nissen, S. Augustine, S. Gregory</hi> the Great, and <hi>S. Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Towers,</hi> and others; will he say that by their reliquatiōs they were also bankrupts in religion? and if not they, then why we? who do no more then they did, as it is euident by the testimonyes, and examples alleadged by me before.</p>
            <p n="83">83. And now to come to his conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, he saith, that <hi>S. Hierome</hi> shall end the matter, who in the lyues of <hi>S. Hilarion,</hi> and <hi>S. Antony</hi> testified that they gaue special or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before their deaths; the one (to wit S. <hi>Hilarion</hi>) to be buryed in his Clothes, and not to be kept aboue ground one minute of an houre <q>(because sayth <hi>M. Collins,</hi> he would not be pickled <hi>vp in reliques;</hi>) and the other to be buryed priuately, least one <hi>Pergamius</hi> a rich man might perhaps steale away his body, and put it in a shryne; and then he addeth, The like was done, saith he, to <hi>Moyses</hi> body for the same cause, God
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:15521:291"/> euery where forbidding to seeke the liuing amongst the dead, as you do playnely in your reliques, worshipping <hi>not thē but Christ in them,</hi> as you stick not to triumph <hi>num</hi> 25. of this Chapter.</q> Thus endeth <hi>M. Collins</hi> his graue discourse, as wisely, as he beganne it, &amp; with the like sincerity that you haue seene him proceed hitherto.</p>

               </gap> you see he alleadgeth heer S. <hi>Hierome</hi> against reliques, as if <hi>S.

Collins</hi> passed ouer with silence, to the end, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that he might the better afterwards make vse of his authority some way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against reliques, as heere you see he hath done, though most idly; seeing all that which he produceth out of the liues of those two fathers written by <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> proueth no more then that which you heard obiected by him before <hi>nu.</hi> 67. out of <hi>Victor Vticensis</hi> concerning <hi>Armogastes,</hi> to wit, that those two holy monks were so
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:15521:292"/> lowly and humble in hart, that they thoght themselues al togeather vnworthy of that honour, which they knew had been done to many holy men after their death, and feared might also be done to them, if they did not preuent it; in which respect (as I said before of <hi>Armogastes</hi>) they were much more honourable in the sight both of God, and man, and therefore were by gods speciall ordinance, (for his owne greater glory and theirs) highly honoured afterward, not only by the celebration of their festiuall dayes in the Church, but also by the veneration, and translation of their holy reliques, which they (out of their humility) sought so much to auoyd.</p>
            <p n="85">85. And this is most euident in <hi>Hilarion,</hi> euen in that place of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> which M. <hi>Collins</hi> alleadgeth &amp; obiecteth to vs, which I beseech thee good Reader, to note, that thou mayst withall consider the honesty of the man. For whereas he alleadgeth out of <hi>S. Hierome</hi> that <hi>S.

                  </gap>o be kept aboue ground one minute of an hower, S Hierome</hi> hauing sayd so (and presently after declared in a few lynes his death, &amp; speedy buriall) addeth that a deare disciple
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:15521:292"/> of his called <hi>Hesychius</hi> being then absent from him in <hi>Palestina,</hi> and hearing of his death, went to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where <hi>Hilarion</hi> dyed, &amp; obteyned to dwell in the garden where he was buryed, and after ten monethes found meanes to steale away his body, &amp; transported it to <hi>Mayona</hi> in <hi>Palestina,</hi> being accompanied with multitudes of monks, and people of the townes adioyning, and there buryed it in an auncient monastery, his Coate, Hood, and Cloake, being still whole, <hi>&amp; toto corpore, quasi adhuc viueret inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro, tantis{que} fragrante odoribus, vt delibutum vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guentis putaretur,</hi> and all his body being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, and entyre, as if he were yet aliue; and so fragrant with sweet odours, that it might be thought to haue byn annoynted with sweet oyntments. Thus sayth S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> who also relateth immediately after, the deuotion <hi>Constantiae, sayth he, illius sanctissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma mulieris,</hi> of the most holy woman <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia,</hi> who was wont <hi>peruigiles in sepulchro eius noctes ducere,</hi> to passe whole nights wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching at his tomb, <hi>&amp; quasi cum presente ad ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuuandas orationes suas, sermocinari,</hi> and to conferre with him, as if he had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to help &amp; further her prayers. Finally <hi>S. Hierome</hi> cōcludeth, that there was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull contention, euen vntill that very
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:15521:293"/> day betwixt the people of <hi>Cyprus</hi> &amp; <hi>Palestin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> affirming that they had the one his body, and the other his spirit, by reason of the great miracles, which were dayly done in both places, albeit they were more frequēt in the garden of <hi>Cyprus: Forsitan</hi> (fayth S. Hierom) <hi>quia plus illum locū dilexerit,</hi> perhaps because he loued that place better. Thus sayth this ancient Father.</p>
            <p n="86">86. Now then out of al this, foure things may be gathered. The first, that Almighty God rewarded his seruants euen in this world, with the honour which he out of his profound humility fled, and thought himselfe vnworthy of. The second that his diuine Maiesty did manifestly confirme, the vse, veneration, and translation of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reliques, aswel by the miraculous preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his seruants body incorrupt, as also by the fragrant odour that issued out of it; for therby it euidently appeared that God of his diuine prouidence ordayned that the body should be taken vp, &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated in such sort as it was; for if it should haue still remained buryed, vnseene, and hidden (as <hi>Hylarion</hi> out of his humility desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it should) these miracles had beene in vaine, and to no purpose; which were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and impious, to say of any worke of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:15521:293"/> God, and especially of any of his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and miraculous workes, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tend to his greater glory, and either to the edification, instruction, and benefit of his seruants, or els to the confusion, and punishment of his enemyes.</p>
            <p n="87">87. The third thing which may be gathered of this history, is not only that it was the custome of holy &amp; deuout people at that tyme to watch whole nights in cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayer at the tombes &amp; monuments of holy mē deceased, but also that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God did satisfy their deuotion, yea, &amp; stir them thereto by frequent miracles, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing thereby the honour that was done to his seruants, according to our Sauiours promise in the holy Scripture: <hi>Si quis mihi ministrauerit, honorificabit eum pater meus,</hi> if any man do serue me, my Father will honour him. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p n="88">88. Lastly, by all this it appeareth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently, that <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath a deplorable cōscience, that makes no scruple to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble such important proofes of the vse and veneration of holy reliques, as these are &amp; to obiect such a trifle as heere he doth, out of the same place, which also rather forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth our cause, then any way impugneth it, seing that it appeareth thereby, that the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:15521:294"/> Reliques of holy men, were at that tyme had in great veneration; for otherwayes, what should moue this holy man <hi>S. Hylari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n,</hi> to feare, that he should be <hi>pickled vp in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi> (as M. <hi>Collins</hi> prophanly speaketh) but that he knew it to be vsuall in the Church to reserue the Reliques of such as had the reputation of extraordinary sanctity, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of those by whome Almighty God had done so many miracles, as he had done by him, albeit he for his part esteemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe altogeather vnworthy, as well of the fauors, which he had receaued of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, as of the opinion which the world had conceaued of him. Thus much concerning <hi>S. Hylarion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="89">89. The like may be sayd of <hi>S. Antony,</hi> whose holy life was no lesse glorious in miracles then the former, in so much that he was held in his tyme for a miracle, and wonder of the world, as appeareth by the history of his life written by <hi>S. Athanasius;</hi> &amp; albeit he also ordained to be buryed secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; charged his disciples that they should not let any man know the place of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall (in which respect it is doubtfull, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> witnesseth, whether <hi>Hilarion</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned of them to see it) yet it pleased God to reueale it about a hundred years after, in
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:15521:294"/> the tyme of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour, wherby his reliques were found, digged vp, &amp; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as testify <hi>Ado, Vsuardus, Sigebertus, Marianus Scotus, Crispinian,</hi> and <hi>S. Bede</hi> our Countreyman, who in his <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loge</hi> 16. <hi>Calend. Febr.</hi> sayth, that <hi>S. Antonyes body being found by diuine reuelation was brought to</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and buryed there in the Church of S. Iohn Baptist.</hi> So he. Loe then how Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God honoured the memory, and reliques of him, who whilest he liued desired they should not be honoured; God so disposing (as I haue signifyed before) for his owne greater glory, &amp; the reward of his seruants humility, whereby it appeareth what a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obiection <hi>M.

               </gap>eth for no other purpose, but to testify, &amp; proue the humility of those holy Monks, and withall to shew his weakne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, &amp; want of better arguments to impugne this most ancient custom of Gods Church, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and practised by so many ancient, and hol Fathers, as you haue heard alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and confirmed by infinite miracles, yea and sufficiently witnessed, euen by those examples, &amp; in those places of the Fathers, which he ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h heere produced: what cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science then hath he, or what honesty, who
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:15521:295"/> seeketh to deceaue, and delude his Readers with a bare shew of the Authority of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when he himselfe seeth that they are flatly against him, euen in those places, which he alleadgeth.</p>
            <p n="90">90. And heerof I may add yet this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe that euen in this conclusion of his discourse wherein he promiseth, to end with <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> he abuseth him notably, not only in dissembling all that which witnesseth the honour done to the reliques of <hi>S. Hylarion,</hi> and the continuall miracles which Almighty God wrought thereby, but also in carping at him, and reprouing him sharply, thogh he doth not name him, but me, and other Catholiks; as he delt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the like manner, with <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> as I obserued <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>num.</hi> 37. <hi>&amp; sequent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="91">91. For he chargeth vs heere with <hi>seeking the liuing amongst the dead, contrary,</hi> sayth he, <hi>to the commandment of God,</hi> because we professe to worship Christ in Reliques; and for the proofe therof he alleadgeth my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder, saying: <hi>as you sticke not to triumph num.</hi> 25. In which number neuerthelesse, I do but only relate <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> whom he confuteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably by the practise, and custome of the whole Church, alleadging to that end two
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:15521:295"/> examples of the solemn translation of holy reliques: the first of the reliques of <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, S. Luke,</hi> and <hi>S. Tymothy</hi> in tyme of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> the Great, and the other of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet trāslated from <hi>Iudaea</hi> to <hi>Chalcedon</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> carryed by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops most sumptuously and triumphantly in a golden vessel, and met, receaued, and accompanied by the people of all the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by the way, sounding forth (sayth <hi>S. Hierom</hi>) the prayse of Christ with one voice all along as they went: whereupon <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> asketh <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> whether he tooke <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadius</hi> the Emperour (who caused this to be done) and al the Bishops which carryed those reliques, and all the people that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed them, for fools, and sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons; and finally he concludeth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryding the folly of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> saying <hi>viz. Adorabant Samuelem non Christum, cuius Samuel &amp; Leuita &amp; Propheta fuit,</hi> belike they adored <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> and not Christ, whose Leuite, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Samuel</hi> was.</p>
            <p n="92">92. Thus far I cyted <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and then I concluded, that he shewed therein the absurdity of <hi>Vigilantius,</hi> who did thinke that Christ was not adored in all this, but <hi>Samuel</hi> only; whereas all the reuerence and honor done by those Bishops to <hi>Samuel</hi> was
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:15521:296"/> indeed (according to <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> discourse) done to Christ, whose <hi>Leuite</hi> and Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> was; because (as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> also sayd before) <hi>the honor of the seruants redoundeth to their Lord;</hi> and this is all which I sayd <hi>num.</hi> 25. Whereupon <hi>M. Collins</hi> chargeth me, and other Catholiques to seeke <hi>the liuing amongst the dead, contrary to the commaundement of God;</hi> whereas you see euidently, that I doe but relate <hi>S. Hieromes</hi> discourse, who therefore is the man that sought <hi>the liuing amongst the dead,</hi> and not only he, but also those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who accompanyed the Reliques of <hi>Samuel,</hi> sounding forth (as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> sayth) the praise of Christ all the way as they went, &amp; consequently honouring Christ in the Reliques of <hi>Samuel,</hi> which with <hi>M. Collins</hi> is to <hi>seeke the liuing amongst the dead, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the commandement of God;</hi> whereby it appeareth what respect he beareth to <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and to the ancient Fathers, when he can vpon any occasion taxe, or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict them vnder hand, albeit he would haue his Readers belieue, that he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them much, and teacheth no other doctrine, but that which is theirs, or most consonant thereunto.</p>
            <p n="93">93. Well then you haue now seene <hi>M. Collins</hi> his deepe discourse against holy
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:15521:296"/> Reliques, being the very quintessence of his skill, drawne out of the limbecke of an hereticall brayne, and therefore sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticated with so much fraud, as no man, that should not euidently see it (as you haue done) would belieue it of any man that hath the face, and reputation of an honest man, and much lesse of a man of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and quality.</p>

<pb n="505" facs="tcp:15521:297"/> Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> concerning certaine cleare testimonyes of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> beliefe &amp; doctrine, touching holy reliques; &amp; this I will do the rather, because by occasion therof I charged my Lord with a notable abuse of S. <hi>Augustin,</hi> &amp; an inexcusable fraud which <hi>M. Collins</hi> was in reason, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty bound to defend, and therefore we will now see how well he hath performed it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <q>Thus then I sayd in my Adyoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>num.</hi> 64. Wheras the Cardinall produceth the euident &amp; cleere testimony of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> to proue that many Miracles were done by the Reliques of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>Affrick, M. Andrews</hi> wisheth the Cardinall to consider how be can well and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly reconcile <hi>Augustine</hi> with <hi>Augustine</hi> cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those Miracles, and his reason is, because <hi>Augustine</hi> saith in an Epistle to his Clergie, and all the people of <hi>Hyppo, Nus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam hic in Africa, talia fieri se scire: he knew that such things were not don any wher in Africk,</hi> which I beseech thee <hi>good Reader</hi> to note, and thou shalt euidently see the good Conscience of <hi>M. Andrews,</hi> who abuseth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly two wayes; the one in making him seeme to contradict himselfe most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly, yea and to giue himselfe, as it were, the lye, witnessing in one place matters of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:15521:298"/> fact vpon his owne knowledge, (for so he testifieth those Miracles done by <hi>S. Stephens</hi> reliques,) and in another place affirming that he knew the same to be false, for so must it needes be, if he knewe that such thinges were not done any where in <hi>Africk.</hi> The other abuse is, in that he peruerteth the sense of <hi>S. Augustines</hi> Epistle, as it will easely appeare, if we consider the occasion why <hi>S. Augustine</hi> wrote the same; which therefore I think good heere to relate.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <q>A scandalous quarrell being fallen out betwixt a Chaplaine of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> and a yong man concerning an infamous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnation raysed by the yong man against the Preist (whereof the truth could not be tried or knowne, because the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended wholly vpon their owne oathes, and testimonyes) <hi>S. Augustin</hi> aduised them to goe to <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> to the body of <hi>S. Faelix,</hi> where it pleased God ordinarily in like cases to discouer periuries, by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous punishment of the periured person; &amp; of this he thought good afterwards to giue account vnto his Clergie and People for their satisfaction, which he did by the Epistle that <hi>M. Andrews</hi> citeth, wherein discoursing, by the occasion of this matter, why Almighty God doth such Miracles
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:15521:298"/> in some place, and not in others, he saith, <hi>Multis notissima est sanctitas loci &amp;c. Many do verie well knowe the holynes of the place, where lyeth the bodie of Blessed Faelix of Nolae, whither I ordeyned them to go, because from thence I might more easely &amp; truly vnderstād by letters whatsoeuer it should please God to manifest in either of them.</hi> So he; and then hauing added, that also in <hi>Millan</hi> a periured theefe was discouered miraculously at the <hi>Monuments</hi> of certaine <hi>Saints,</hi> and forced to restore that which he had stolne, he saith further thus, <hi>Numquid non Africa &amp;c.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ick full of the bodies of holy Martyrs? &amp; tamen nusquam hic scimus talia fieri &amp;c. And neuerthelesse we know that such things</hi> (that is to say Miracls in this kind) <hi>are not don anywhere here in Africk. For euen as the Apostle sayth, that al holy men haue not the guifts of healing, so also he who diuideth things proper, or peculiar to euery one as it pleaseth him, would not haue these things to be done at all the memories or monuments of Saynts.</hi>
               </q> Thus sayth <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <q>Whereby I doubt not, but thou seest, <hi>good Reader,</hi> in what sense he denieth Miracles to haue byn done in <hi>Affrick,</hi> that is to say, such Miracles as were done at the body of S. <hi>Faelix,</hi> for the discouery and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of periury, &amp; not such as he testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth els where, to haue byn ordinarily
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:15521:299"/> done at the Reliques of <hi>S. Stephen,</hi> wherof he recounteth such a multitude, with such asseueration of his owne knowledge ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and publique testimony of an infinite number of witnesses, and such particuler relation of circumstances, tymes, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that a man must hould him for the most impudent lyar, that euer wrote, if they were not most true. Besides, that writing the same, as he did for the proofe of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion against <hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells,</hi> it cannot without extreme folly be imagined that such a learned, wise, and holy man, as he, would be so prodigall not only of his owne credit, and reputatiō, but also of the honour of Christiā Religiō, as to expose the same to the derision of the Paynims, by seking to confirme it by fables and lyes, which euery man in those parts (as well the Paynims themselues as others) might haue controlled, &amp; would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, if they had byn faigned.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <q>Finally, these miracles of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> which <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> calleth here in question, are testified by <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in that worke which <hi>M. Andrews</hi> himselfe so much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth els where, that alledging out of it a sentence which he thought might make for him, he calleth it <hi>Opus palmare de ciuitate
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:15521:299"/> Dei, the principall or most excellent worke of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine of the Citty of God.</hi> And yet now he would faine disgrace it, or rather <hi>S. Augustin</hi> himselfe by the imputation of a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which he would the Reader should suppose to be betwixt it, and the foresaid Epistle of S. <hi>Augustine;</hi> wheras you see (and <hi>M. Andrews</hi> knoweth it in his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) that there is no contradiction in the world betwixt them, but that both of them do notably and clearly testify the ancient and venerable vse of holy <hi>Reliques,</hi> and the miraculous assistance, and helpe that God giueth to his faithfull people thereby, and by the praiers and Reliques of his holy Martyrs &amp; Saints. So that truly a man may wonder at the impudency, and seared Conscience of <hi>M. Andrews,</hi> who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to delude his Reader with such a frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent and inexcusable abuse of this holy Father.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus sayd I in my Adioynder, wherein I doubt not, but thou seest, good Reader, matter right worthy to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>M. Collins</hi> for the defence of my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> whom I charged deeply with egregious fraud, and abuse of <hi>S. Augustine.</hi> Neuerthelesse I may well say, that M. <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins obmutuit,</hi> is as dumbe as a Dogge, for he
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:15521:300"/> sayth not one word to it, but abandoneth his Lordship quite, leauing him to answer for himselfe, as he hath done before diuers tymes. And whereas my discourse in my Adioynder, contayned also important matter for the proofe of the vse, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of holy reliques (by reason of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> vndoubted testimony of notable miracles done as well at the body of S. <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> in <hi>Nola,</hi> and the monuments of certaine Saints in <hi>Millan</hi> as also at the reliques of S. <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>Afrike) M. Collins</hi> is no lesse silent thereto, then to what I obiected to my Lord, omitting all mention of either of both in this place, I meane, in his ninth Chapter. But afterwards in his answere to my tenth Chapter (where I had occasion to alleadge againe the same testimony of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) he thought good to say somewhat thereto, though he doth it with so grosse, and palpable fraud, that I cannot omit to discou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For one tyme he confesseth of the aforesayd won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that, <hi>Non sunt tanta autoritate commendata</hi> &amp;c. <hi>They are not of such authority, as straight wayes to be belieued, though betweene one faythfull man, and another.</hi> Another tyme he sayes: <hi>That as soone as they are told they are cleane forgotten, &amp; no body relates them to them that did not heare them, as they were rehearsed</hi> de libello, <hi>nor no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy remembers them any long tyme himselfe. His wordes are: Nec (admodum) innotescunt, neque vt non excidant animo, quasi glarea memoriae crebra lectione tundūtur:</hi> wheras if they were diuine miracles, why should they not be diuulged throughout the whole world, euen where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Ghospell is preached, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour sayd of the Charity of that good woman that annoynted his feet? Againe: <hi>Semel hoc audiunt qui adsunt, plures{que} non adsunt, vt nec illi qui affuerunt post aliquot dies mente reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant, &amp; vix quisquam reperiatur illorum, qui ei quem non affuisse cognouerit, iudicet quod audiuit.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus farre doth <hi>M. Collins</hi> alleadge
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:15521:301"/> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> his text, hoping to perswade his Reader therby, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> did not hold those miracles which he related, to be diuine miracles, not to be of such authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as to deserue to be diuulged throughout the world, as diuine miracles ought to be. But to the end that thou mayst see good Reader, how shamfully he seeketh to abuse thee, peruerting S. <hi>Augustine</hi> his sense cleane contrary to his meaning, thou shalt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> throughout all that worthy work of his <hi>de ciuitate Dei,</hi> wryteth purposely against the Paymins, and hauing vrged in the 22. booke, the conuersion of the world to the fayth of Christ by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he obiecteth against himself in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Paynins thus: <hi>Cur inquiunt, nunc illa miracula quae praedicatis facta esse, non fiunt? why are not those miracles done now which you say were then done?</hi> Wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o he answereth, that he might say that those miracles were then necessary before the world did beleiue, to the end that it might beleiue, and that whosoeuer would seeke for new miracles to belieue in Christ, now when the whole world belieueth, he is to be held for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious wonder.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But, sayth he, <hi>The Paynims do say this, for no other cause, but because they do not belieue that
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:15521:301"/> those miracles were then done;</hi> thus fayth <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi> and thereupon he vrgeth the cred it, and authority of the holy Scriptures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued and belieued throughout the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world, whereby those miracles, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the diuinity of Christ, are not only published, but also belieued, &amp; authorized euery where: and then comming to that which M. <hi>Collins</hi> obiecteth, he sayth first thus: <hi>Nam etiam nunc fiunt miracula in eius no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For miracles are also done now in his name, either by his Sacraments, or by the prayers or memoryes of his Saints, but they are not so cleare and famous, as to be published with as great glory as the other; for the Canon of the holy Scripture, which was to be euery where diuulged, doth make them to be read euerywhere, and to be fixed in the memory of all people, but these miracles which are now done are skant knowne by all the Citty or place wher they were done. For it so falleth out very often, that they are knowne but to a few, the rest being ignorant of them, especially if the Citty be great, and when they are tould elswhere to others, the authority which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth them is not so great, that they are fully belieued without doubt, or difficulty, albeit they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by faythfull Christians one to another.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Augustine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Now then this being the first part of that which <hi>M. Collins</hi> alleadgeth (but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:15521:302"/> as you haue seene) I remit it to any mans iudgment, whether <hi>S. Augustine</hi> doe heerby deny, either that the miracls wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he spake, were diuine miracles, or that they ought to be published euery where; seeing all that he sayth is in substance this; that the miracles since Christs tyme, &amp; the Apostles (not testifyed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) neither are, nor can be so generally knowne, and belieued as those which are mentioned in the Scriptures, because these later miracles, are not knowne, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but in particuler places, neyther yet so fully belieued of all the Christians that are in those places, or heare of them, as those other which the Scripture relateth, because the Scripture being generally receaued, &amp; belieued euery where as infallibly true, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth also vndoubted credit, and authority euery where to the miracles which are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed, and related therein.</p>
            <p n="10">10. How then doth it follow heerō that these later miracles are not diuine miracles? For he that should say so, must also say that Almighty God neuer did miracle since the Apostles tyme, because later miracles are not related in Scripture. But <hi>S. Augustine</hi> contradicteth this expresly, for hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a great number of miracles done at
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:15521:302"/> the reliques of <hi>S. Stephen</hi> he concludeth thus: <hi>Fiunt ergo etiam nunc multa miracula, eodem Deo faciente, per quos vult, &amp; quemadmodum vult, qui &amp; illa, quae legimus fecit: Therefore there are now also miracles done, the same God doing them, by whome he will, and as he will, who also did those which we read</hi> (in the Scripture.) Thus sayth <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> whereby it is euident that he acknowledgeth those miracles which he had related to be diuine miracles, no lesse then those which are mentioned in the Scripture, seeing that they were wrought, as he sayth, by the same God who wrought the other.</p>
            <p n="11">11. What extreme impudency then is this in <hi>M. Collins</hi> to inferre vpon S. <hi>Augustines</hi> words that the miracles recounted by him were not diuine miracles, when <hi>S. Augustine</hi> flatly affirmeth that they were? Wherein it is also to be noted that those wordes of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> wherein he affirmed it, went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly before those, wherupon <hi>M. Collins</hi> inferreth the contrary. For <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sayd, that many miracles are don also now by Almighty God, addeth: <hi>Sed nec ista similiter innotescunt &amp;c.</hi> which later wordes, <hi>M. Collins</hi> layeth downe, omitting the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, &amp; then glosseth the later thus: <hi>VVheras</hi> (sayth he) <hi>if these were diuine miracles, why should
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:15521:303"/> they not be diuulged throughout the world &amp;c.</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying that the later miracles (whereof S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speaketh) were not diuulged ouer all the world, because they were not diuine miracles; whereas neuerthelesse S. <hi>Augustine</hi> sayd immediatly before, that they were done by Almighty God, who did those other also which were read in holy Scripture, so as he only maketh this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the one, and the other, that those in the Scripture, are published, diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp; belieued, euery where by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people, &amp; the other are not so diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and belieued; but only knowne and belieued in certaine places, and by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler persons, though they be diuine miracles no lesse then the former.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Furthermore, it is to be obserued for the further discouery of his fraud heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that he not only dissembleth the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the sentence (which maketh flatly against him) but also changeth in the later part (which he alleadgeth) an important, &amp; significant word which sheweth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance of that which he cyteth vpon the former part, which he concealeth. For whereas <hi>S. Augustine</hi> speaking of the later miracles, sayth: <hi>Nec ista similiter innotescunt, M. Collins</hi> alleadgeth it, <hi>Nec ista admodum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notescunt,</hi>
               <pb n="517" facs="tcp:15521:303"/> wherin this difference is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the word <hi>simliter</hi> doth import a comparison of the later miracles, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which he hath mentioned before, that is to say, with miracles testifyed by holy Scripture; and therfore hauing sayd that God doth miracles now, <hi>Qui &amp; illa quae legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imus fecit; who did all those which we read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> he addeth presently, <hi>Sed nec ista similiter innotescunt &amp;c. But these</hi> (later miracles) <hi>are not diuulged</hi> (or generally knowne) <hi>in like manner as the other &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="13">13. This then being the true sense, &amp; meaning of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> it is euident that in this one sentence of his, there may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted three notable fraudes of <hi>M. Collins.</hi> The first, his lame cytation of it, omitting the first part of the sentence, whereupon the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dependeth. The second, the change of <hi>similiter</hi> into <hi>admodum</hi> in the later part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>similiter</hi> might discouer the depēdance of the later part vpō the former. The third (which is one of the notablest falsityes that euer I saw) his false inference vpon the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part, flatte contrary to the expresse wordes of the former, which therefore he wittingly, and purposely concealed: so as it is hard to say, whether my Lord of <hi>VVin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> or <hi>M. Collins,</hi> haue more abused <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:15521:304"/> about the reliques of <hi>S. Stephen.</hi> My Lord vpon pretence of an Epistle of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines,</hi> which he most willfully peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, calleth in question, whether there were euer any such miracles done or no, notwithstanding <hi>S. Augustine</hi> his euident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony therof vpon his owne knowledg; <hi>M. Collins</hi> though he will not deny that such miracles were done, yet he laboureth to perswade his Reader, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> did not make any great accompt of them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as of diuine miracles: &amp; to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he hath egregiously peruerted as you see, both <hi>S. Augustines</hi> text, and meaning, contrary to his expresse words, in so much that both my Lord and his Champion do make <hi>S. Augustine</hi> contradict himselfe expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly, and deny that which he constantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Neuertheles <hi>M. Collins</hi> not content with this, addeth another fraud touching the same point, no lesse remarkable then the former: for whereas I vrged in my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder that these miracles recounted by S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> were a manifest confirmation of the vse and veneration of holy Reliques, he answereth <hi>pag.</hi> 441. <hi>lin.</hi> 21. that, <hi>Non se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur consequentia à miraculis ad cultum, VVitnes,</hi> sayth he, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:15521:304"/>
               <hi>de notis Ecclesiae.</hi> And this <hi>M. Collins</hi> affirmeth afterwardes againe <hi>pag.</hi> 449. <hi>lin.</hi> 7. saying thus: <hi>This is starke false that Miracls done at Saints bodyes infer the honour which you challeng to them, by any probable consequence, as</hi> Bellarmine <hi>denyes about</hi> Hieremyes <hi>body, and was quoted to you a little before out of his booke de notis Ecclesiae.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>M. Collins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in that Chapter which he quoteth hath no such thing, but rather the contrary; for he teacheth and proueth there, that miracles are not only necessary, but also sufficient to proue a new fayth; and amongst the obiections of our aduersaryes, he hath this (out of <hi>Caluins</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his Institutions, and the <hi>Magdebur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genses</hi>) that true miracles do confirme the Ghospell <hi>(Marci vltimo)</hi> and that these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of ours doe ouerthrow it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme Idolatry, that is (say they) the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of reliques, &amp; Images, the inuocation of Saints, Masse &amp;c. So as according to <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> our Aduersayes themselues doe graunt that the consequence is good, <hi>à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculis ad cultum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. For if true miracles confirme the Ghospell, then consequently they do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the true worship of God, which is taught, and deliuered by the Ghospel; and
<pb facs="tcp:15521:305"/> conforme to this, our Aduersaryes do also affirme that our miracles (which they will needs haue to be false miracles) do confirm Idolatry, that is (say they) the worshippe of Saints, and Reliques &amp;c. and therefore according to their opinion we may well say, that as false miracles doe confirme false worship, so true miracles do confirme true worship; whereupon it also follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that if the miracles which are done by reliques, can be proued to be true miracles, the worship of reliques is a true, &amp; lawfull worship, and not Idolatry. So as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euen in that Chapter of Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> cyted by <hi>M. Collins,</hi> that our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saryes themselues do graunt in their obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that the consequence is good, <hi>à mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculis ad cultum;</hi> and the Cardinall doth not deny it in the solution, but only sayth in answere of the obiection thus: <hi>Sed, inquiunt, ista miracula euertunt Euangelium. Respondeo, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum est, sed Caluini, non Christi: vel probent isti quod tam audacter affirmant.</hi> But they say that those miracles (of ours) do ouerthrow the Ghospell. I answere, it is true, but the Ghospell of <hi>Caluin,</hi> and not of Christ, or els let them proue that which they so boldly affirme.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Thus sayth the Cardinall, and
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:15521:305"/> then proceedeth to the confutation of foure arguments of theirs, whereby they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to proue that miracles do not <hi>facere cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam fidem,</hi> amongst the which their third argument is, that miracles were done in tymes past at the Prophet <hi>Hieremyes</hi> tombe, by the illusion of the Diuell, which they say, was manifest, because those miracles were don to the benefite of those, who did worship <hi>Hieremy</hi> with sacrifices and diuine honour, as a God; whereto the Cardinall answereth thus: <hi>Ad tertium,</hi> sayth he, <hi>dico, mendaciū esse Caluini &amp;c. To the third, I say, that it is a lye of</hi> Caluin, <hi>that the people did worship</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, <hi>with sacrifices, and diuine honours, for he bringeth no witnes of it, but only hath in his margent</hi> Hieronymus praefatione in Hieremiam. <hi>But neither in the presace of</hi> Hierome <hi>to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Hieremy <hi>whome he translated, neither in his preface to the Commentaryes of</hi> Hieremy, <hi>there is any mention at all of this history: moreouer there is another little Preface prefixed before the Prophet</hi> Hieremy, <hi>in the</hi> Bibles <hi>set forth by</hi> Benedictus, <hi>whereat</hi> Caluin <hi>aymed, as it seemeth, but that preface is not</hi> Hieromes, <hi>neither is there any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein of sacrifices, or diuine honour, but only that miracles were done at his sepulcher. Finally</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius <hi>and</hi> Isidore, <hi>in the life of</hi> Hieremy, <hi>do say indeed that miracles were done, but of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:15521:306"/> or diuyne honour done vnto him, they say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Thus sayth the Cardinall, and this is all he sayth to that obiection, or concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning miracles done at <hi>Hieremyes</hi> body.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Now then; how doth the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deny heere, the consequence <hi>à miraculis ad cultum?</hi> Is there any one word therein, which may be wrested to any such sense? Wherin al we see is, that <hi>Caluin</hi> is taken tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and charged with a manifest lye; but of the Cardinalls denyall of that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, not so much as one sillable, either there, or in all that Chapter, wherein his speciall drift is, to proue that new miracles are sufficient to confirme, and proue any point of fayth not belieued, or taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which the Cardinall layeth for a foū<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ground in the very beginning of the Chapter: and vpon this ground, &amp; the reason which he giueth to proue the same, it followeth directly that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is good, <hi>à miraculis ad cultum:</hi> for thus argueth the Cardinall: <hi>Vera miracula</hi> (sayth he) <hi>non possunt fieri, nisi Dei virtute</hi> &amp;c. <hi>True miracles cannot be done, but by the power of God, and therefore they are called in Scripture the testimonyes of God, so as that which is confirmed by miracle, is confirmed by Gods testimony: but God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be witnes of a lye; therefore that which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:15521:306"/> by a miracle, must needs be true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. Thus sayth the Cardinall, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it must needes follow also, that if the worship of Saints Reliques, or Images be confirmed by a true miracle, it must needes be a true, and lawfull worship; seeing then this directly followeth vpon the Cardinals groundes, discourse, and doctrine in that Chapter, <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath extremely abused, and belyed him, in making him a witnesse of the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> that, <hi>Non sequitur conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia à miraculis ad cultum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. Moreouer the Cardinall is so farre from denying that consequence, that in his second Booke <hi>De beatitudine Sanctorum c.</hi> 3 §. <hi>Quartò probatur,</hi> he proueth directly the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratiō, &amp; worship of holy reliques, by the miracles done at them: <hi>Quae miracula</hi> (sayth he) <hi>certè non fierent, si Deo cultus reliquiarum non placeret,</hi> which miracles would not be don, if the worship of reliques did not please God, whereof he alleadgeth many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples out of S. <hi>Epiphanius in vita Isaiae, Ezechielis, Hieremiae. S. Basil. orat. in Mamantem. S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nazianzen orat. in Cyprianum. S. Chrysostome in lib. contra Gent. Palladius in historia lauriaca c.</hi> 26. S. <hi>Ambrose serm. de</hi> SS. <hi>Geruasio &amp; Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio.</hi> S. <hi>Hierome contra Vigilantium. S. Augustine lib.</hi> 22. <hi>de ciuitate Dei. cap.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="21">
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:15521:307"/>21. And hereto the Cardinall addeth also a further proof thereof (§. <hi>Quintò pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur</hi>) by miracles which haue often beene seene euen in the dead bodyes of Saints, <hi>Per quae,</hi> sayth he, <hi>Deus apertissimè nos ad eorum venerationem inuitare videtur,</hi> by the which God doth manifestly seeme to inuite vs to the worship or veneration of them; and heerof he also alleadgeth diuers notable examples, as out of <hi>S. Chrysostome</hi> in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the <hi>SS. Iuuentius</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximus,</hi> whose faces he saith, appeared resplendant after their death. Also <hi>S. Hierome</hi> affirmeth of <hi>S. Hilarion,</hi> that his body was found entyre after ten moneths, and so fragrant that it might seem to be anoynnted with sweet oyntments. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> witnesseth <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>Confess. cap.</hi> 7. that the bodyes of <hi>SS. Geruase</hi> and <hi>Protase,</hi> were found whole and vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Bassula</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed that the body of S. <hi>Martyn</hi> was after his death more like a glorifyed body, then the body of a dead man. <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> affirmeth the like of the body of Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> Lastly the Cardinall concludeth with the euident and dayly experience of the oyle which doth miraculously distill from the body of <hi>S. Andrew</hi> the <hi>Apostle;</hi> all which the Cardinall alleadgeth to proue
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:15521:307"/> that holy reliques are to be worshipped. This then being so, how shameles is <hi>Collins,</hi> who calleth the Cardinall to witnes that there is no consequence <hi>à miraculis ad cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. But to returne to <hi>S. Augustines</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony concerning the miracles done at S. <hi>Stephen</hi> reliques, you haue seene it proued euidētly, how notoriously false it is which <hi>M. Collins</hi> hath gathered out of him, to wit, that he did not esteeme the said miracles to be diuine miracles; when neuertheles he sayth, that they were don by the same God who did the miracles which are testified in holy scripture; whereupon it followeth that the honour done to those reliques in the solemne translation, and circumgesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them (to vse stil <hi>M. Collins</hi> his phrase) was gratefull to Almighty God, who did miraculously comfort, and releiue those who with deuotion, did concurre, and cooperate thereto, or had recourse to them; whereby the sick recouered their health, the blynd their sight, and the dead their life; in so much that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> giueth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of fiue or sixe seuerall dead persons reuyued, partly by the application of som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that had but only touched the holy reliques, and partly by the oyle of the lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:15521:308"/> that burned before them, which ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth <hi>oleum Martyris,</hi> the oyle of the Martyr.</p>
            <p n="23">23. And this I mention the rather, because <hi>M. Collins</hi> doth formalyze himselfe very seriously against the custome that thē was to apply to diseased persons the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that had touched the reliques of Saints; and this he doth by the occasion of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle related by me in my Adioynder out of S. <hi>Augustine de ciuitate Dei, vbi supra,</hi> where he testifyeth that a blynde woman was restored to her sight, by applying to her eyes certaine flowers that had touched the holy reliques of S. <hi>Stephen;</hi> which M. <hi>Collins</hi> laboureth to proue to haue beene no good custome, euen by the authority of S. <hi>Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> himselfe, which I beseech thee, <hi>good Reader,</hi> wel to note, and the notable foolery and fraud withal of this idle fellow. Thus then he sayth <hi>pag.</hi> 448. <hi>lin.</hi> 15. In the 8. booke, sayth he, <hi>of the aforesaid</hi> worke <hi>cap.</hi> 27. <q>he <hi>(S. Augustine)</hi> allowes not of meates to be set vpon Martyrs tombes, for obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of blessing; <hi>a Christianis melioribus,</hi> sayth he, <hi>hoc non fit,</hi> he denyes not but it is done, but he sayes the better sort of <hi>Christians</hi> do it not, much lesse flowers to be layd vpon their bodyes, and taken of agayne, with
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:15521:308"/> hope of vertue to proceed from them in application to sicke folkes; for of sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meates to necessary vse, wee read in the Apostle (and the martyrs might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to it if they were <hi>Conscious</hi>) but of the flowers no where, nor to such purpose, especially from the dead. The Christians then might do this in <hi>S. Augustines</hi> tyme, but not the better sort of Christians as he most aduisedly speakes, not <hi>meliores Christiani,</hi> whom you list not to imitate, but choose the worser part, and clout a religion out of fond Customes, which the iudicious of those tymes neyther allowed then, &amp; much lesse would now.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. Thus iangleth this cozening Companion, who can say nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some fraud, as heer you see. He telleth you of flowers layd vpon the dead bodyes of Saints, and applyed to sick folkes in S. <hi>Augustines</hi> tyme, but what effects followed it, or with what circumstances, or to what purpose S. <hi>Augustine</hi> speakes of it, he sayth not one word, and therefore he more bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly argueth agaynst it, out of another place of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> as against a custome not vsed by the better sort of Christians, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by S. <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe, or by the iudicious of those tymes. Whereas S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
               <pb n="528" facs="tcp:15521:309"/> speaketh not of flowers otherwaies, but only in relating a notable miracle done by Almighty God vpon a blynd woman, who was restored to her sight, by applying to her eyes the flowers that had touched the holy reliques of S. <hi>Stephen;</hi> wherupon it should follow (according to <hi>M. Collins</hi> his assertion) that if it were a bad custome to vse flowers to that purpose, God did by a miracle approue a bad custome, and do a singuler benefit to one of the worser sort of Christians, that vsed the same; yea and it would followe also that S. <hi>Augustin;</hi> wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against the <hi>Paynims</hi> (as he did in that book and Chapter) fortyfied and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our Christian religion by bad custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes not vsed amongst the better sort of Christians, and disallowed also by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; for so will M. <hi>Collins</hi> haue you to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p n="25">25, But who would not detest the fraud, and laugh at the folly of this absurd fellow? who maketh <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himself, vpon no better a ground, then <hi>S. Augustins</hi> dislike of an other custome, not vsed by the better sort of Christians; which yet proueth no more against this custome impugned by M. <hi>Collins,</hi> thē against any other thing, that he, or any body els
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:15521:309"/> shall list to reiect for a bad custome. For what good argument can <hi>M. Collins</hi> make out of that place of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> against the forsayd application of flowers? Will he argue thus? <hi>S. Augustine</hi> disallowed the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of setting meat vpon Martyrs Tombs to be blessed, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he disalowed the custom of applying to the sicke the flowers that had touched the Reliques of Saints? <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum admissi risum teneatis amici!</hi> Besides that, the difference of these two customes was such in <hi>S. Augustines</hi> opinion, that he reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the one in expresse words, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth the other clearely inough, in that he alleadgeth it against the Paynims, to proue the continuance of diuine miracles, relating that miracle done vpon the blynd woman, by the meanes of those flowers.</p>
            <p n="26">26. And to the same purpose he also recounteth afterwardes another notable miracle done in like manner by flowers, vpon a sicke Paynim, who being in great danger of death, and earnestly solicited by his sonne in law, and daughter (who were Christians) to imbrace the Christian fayth, most obstinatly resisted, vntill his sonne-in law (after most feruent prayer made at the Reliques of <hi>S. Stephen</hi>) tooke some of the flowers which were vpon the Altar, and at
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:15521:310"/> night conueyed them vnder the sicke mans head; who sleeping after a whyle, was so moued in his sleep to be a Christian, that he cryed out before morning to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and after his Baptisme repeated conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually the last wordes of <hi>S. Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. viz. <hi>Christe accipe spiritum meum</hi> (albeit he had neuer heard them related) in so much that they were also his last wordes; for he dyed shortly after of the same sicknes.</p>
            <p n="27">27. Thus doth <hi>S. Augustine</hi> recount this miracle done also by flowers, taken only from the altar wher S. <hi>Stephens</hi> reliques were kept; and now were it not absurd &amp; ridiculous to imagine that he disliked this vse of those flowers, wherby God wroght so great a miracle? Or that he esteemed the pious &amp; godly sonne-in-law of that Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nime, for a Christian of the worser sort, because he vsed those flowers to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?

<pb n="531" facs="tcp:15521:310"/> that they were also Christians of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort that applyed the same? Or that <hi>S.

For clothes, and garments haue no more warrant, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, or vertue for that purpose, then flowers haue; so as by <hi>M. Collins</hi> his graue censure, the greatest miracles, that <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> relateth (as the reuyuing of the dead, which surpassed the Diuels power, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must needs be diuine miracles) were done by bad customes, that is to say, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes, and those which vsed thē were Christians of the worser sort, euen in S. <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion, though he recount the same for the confusion of the Paynims, and for the honour and proofe of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian religion.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Loe then what an absurd fellow I haue to deale withall, and also how false &amp; fraudulent he is, who not only dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth my whole text, but also shamefully peruerteth <hi>S. Augustines</hi> meaning, the better to couer his owne imposture. But to draw to an end, and to conclude with somwhat more concerning the translation, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgestation of holy reliques (which <hi>M.
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:15521:311"/> Collins</hi> so much disliketh) the vse and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of both is euident inough, euen in those examples alleadged by me in my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynder out of that booke, and chapter of <hi>S.

            <p n="29">29. And first, for the circumgestation of reliques, the practise of it is manifest in two examples related by <hi>S.

               <pb n="533" facs="tcp:15521:311"/>30. And as for the translation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, it is as cleare as the Sunne, that those reliques, whereby all those miracles were done in <hi>Africke,</hi> were translated thither; for <hi>S. Stephen</hi> was not martyred in Africke, but at <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> besides that, there is sufficient testimony in approued Authours of the tyme and occasion of their translation, as that <hi>Orosius</hi> being sent by <hi>S.

Booke <hi>de ciuitate Dei,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth that he hath not tyme to write all that he knew, and therefore craueth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Reader, yeilding this reason.</p>
            <p n="31">31. <hi>Si enim,</hi> sayth he, <hi>miracula sanitatum, vt alia taceam</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For if</hi> I <hi>would now write the miracles of cures, and healing of diseases (to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) which haue beene done by this Martyr (that is to say, most glorious</hi> Stephen) <hi>in the Colony of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama, <hi>and in ours; very many bookes were to be written, and yet all could not be gathered, but those only, which haue beene set downe in little bookes, or registers, to be read to the people: for when we saw the signes of diuin vertues (that is to say the miracles) like vnto the ould, to be so frequently done in our tyme, we thought good to ordayne, that they should be
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:15521:312"/> registred, and read, to the end that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and come to the knowledge of many. It is not yet two yeares, since this memory began to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated heere at</hi> Hyppo, <hi>and albeit the registers, which haue beene made of many of the miracles that haue beene wrought, haue not beene giuen vp (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am most assured) yet those miracles which haue beene written, and giuen vp, do arriue almost to the number of</hi> 70. <hi>now when I write this; and at</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lama, <hi>where the memory began before we had it heere, the number is incomparably greater; also at</hi> Vzalis (<hi>which is a Colony neere to</hi> Vtica) <hi>I know many notable thinges haue beene done by the same Martyr, but the custome of registring them, is not, or rather hath not beene vsed there; but now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is begun there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="32">32. Thus sayth S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and then recounteth a notable miracle done lately before (when he himselfe was there) vpon a noble woman called <hi>Petronia,</hi> which he sayth he caused her to register: and when he hath related the sayd miracle, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth after a few lines, with that which <hi>M.

<pb n="536" facs="tcp:15521:313"/> did those which we read</hi> (in the Scripture:) <hi>but these neither are diuulged, and made knowne alike (as the others are) neither are they with often rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so beaten into the memory of men, that they be not forgotten &amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="33">33. Thus farre I haue thought good to lay downe S. <hi>Augustine his wordes,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein I wish these things to be noted; first, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> acknowledgeth innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miracles to haue beene done by the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of S. <hi>Stephen;</hi> the second, that they were diuyne miracles, and esteemed, and declared for such by <hi>S.

Thirdly that the custome of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating, and carrying reliques with solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was not only vsuall in the Church in <hi>S.

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:15521:313"/> of reliques to be not only lawful, but also most acceptable to almighty God, and therefore, both my Lord of <hi>VVinchester,</hi> and <hi>M.
